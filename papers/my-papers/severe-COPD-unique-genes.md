# Severe COPD paper

## Discussion
- We found less _[[VEGFA]]_ in sCOPD compared to non-COPD
- This is an association with sCOPD
- We did not measure progression of disease


Our findings of reduced VEGFA expression in severe COPD are of interest. VEGFA is a key growth factor for building lung architecture. It was previously shown that loss of VEGFA leads to endothelial cell apoptosis and dissapearance of lung tissue in COPd, possibly due to reduced blood supply from small capillaries leading to loss of alveolar septa. Our findings support a role for VEGFA in development of sCOPD.

## Comments
**Corry-Anke:**
    What would/could be the role of _VEGFA_ in epithelial cells in bronchus and nose and does it make sense that the expression of this gene is lower in sCOPD? If epithelial cells produce more/less _VEGFA_ how would this than affect its neighbouring cells that may express the receptors? How does it connect to the surroundings genes in the pathways, can they maybe form an explanation?

**Maarten:**
	Dit is toch niet logisch want precies tegengesteld. A) Blockage of VEGF leads to more small airway disease. And b) the lower expression of VEGFA means less protection.
    See attached manuscript. You can use that to write some more on the role of VEGFA in COPD. Very important to start making clear for yourself what message is. Then very clear explanation not only description of literature, but also what it exactly means in context of your findings.

    Another gene of interest was fibronectin 1
