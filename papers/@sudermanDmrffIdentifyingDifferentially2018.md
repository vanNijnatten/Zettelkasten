## Abstract
See also: [[dna-methylation|DNA methylation]] .

DMR: genomic region in which DNA methylation is consistently positive or negatively associate with a phenotype or exposure

Nessecary for proper DMR identification/trying to overcome
- control false positive rates
- low power
- modelling flexibility

## Methods
### DMRff
DMRff does not assume independence between CpG sites, as this is rarely the case. Instead it uses "an extension of inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis"[^1].

- EWAS (limma) effect with the same sign
- EWAS nominal p-value <0.05
- B/S statistic is calculated for each region (distance) and sub-region
  - Most extreme statistic that do not overlap with previously identified candidated
- P-values are Bonferroni-adjusted

### Validation
- Limma for EWAS
- Max distance = 500bp

## Results

## Conclusion
