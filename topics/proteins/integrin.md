# Integrins
>Cell-[[ECM]] interactions are mediated primarily by a family of cell surface receptors called [[integrins]] (Hynes, 1992) Integrins are **heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins** providing links between **extracellular matrix** and **intracellular cytoskeleton**, and may be involved in signal transduction processes. The ligands for integrins include a number of ECM proteins such as **fibronectin (FN), laminin, collagens and vitronectin**. Even though each integrin has a characteristic ligand specificity, many integrins have multiple ECM ligands and each ECM protein has multiple integrin receptors. (quoted from [^ref1])

Types
(More receptor/ligand connections can be found via Uniprot)
- Integrin Î±1 - CD49a - _[[ITGA1]]_
- Integrin Î±5 - CD49e - _[[ITGA5]]_/FNRA
- Integrin Î±v - CD51 - _[[ITGAV]]_
- Integrin Î²1 - CD29 - _[[ITGB1]]_
- Integrin Î²3 - CD61 - _[[ITGB3]]_

Combinations
 - Î±1Î²1 - receptor for [[laminin]] and [[collagen]]
 - Î±5Î²1 - receptor for [[FN1]] [^ref1], [[fibrinogen]] and [[PLA2G2A]]
 - Î±vÎ²3 - receptor for [[FN1]],

## No reference
- Î±5Î²1 and Î±vÎ²3 interact with [[FN1]]
  - Î±5Î²1 interacts with the RGD region of FN (Pytela et al., 1985) [^ref1]
- Cells are able to migrate using [[FN1]] despite absence of (function of) Î±5Î²1 (quoted from [^ref1])
