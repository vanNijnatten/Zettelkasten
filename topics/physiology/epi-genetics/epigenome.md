# Epigenome
"The epigenome consists of chemical compounds that modify, or mark, the genome in a way that tells it what to do, where to do it, and when to do it." [^1]

The epigenome consists of chemical compounds that modify which parts of the [[genome]] is [[dna-translation|translated]] into [[rna|RNA]]. This means that, for example, if a CpG site or a region of CpG sites is methylated, and that site or region is in or close to a promotor or gene, this will have a negative effect on the binding of transcription factors and DNA polymerase, and thus this gene can become less expressed.
The epigenome is different for every cell, even a different cell of the same type, due to inheritance of said chemical compounds. The epigenome is also different for the same cell when it is later in its life cycle.

**Therefore:**
Epigenetics is the study that deals with the epigenome.

**See also:**
- [[dna-methylation|DNA methylation]]
- [[histone-methylation|Histone methylation]]
- [[non-coding-rna|Non-coding RNA]] - though this is debatable since it does not modify the genome. Non-coding RNAs have effect on [[post-processing]] in stead of in the moment regulation of DNA translation.
