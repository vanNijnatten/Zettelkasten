# Notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eyph66mQlfg w/ Rachel Jepsen & Taha Khan
- We write to
  - discover
    - self discovery
      - what do I think/believe/want/have I been through/etc
      - critically think
    - general discovery
      - process of understanding
  - communicate/translate
    - translate your thoughts to paper and to someone else
- Writing is not
  - transcription
    - "I have an idea and want to record it on a piece of paper"
    - "what do I want to say and how do I broadcast that?"
- Writing for
  - specific and real people

School
- In school you "have to be right", to show to the teacher that you understand the subject matter
  - Demonstrate knowledge
  - we cannot experiment and have things wrong (aka, no real discovery)
  - Therefore as adults we think that once you write things down, its there to be judged
- In school you have to follow a format

Good vs Bad writing
- Is contextual
- Ignores its audience completely
  - culture/mood/

Academics
- The purpose of academic writing is to
  - get/keep a job (create a niche for oneself)
  - to communicate 
- Difficulty of academic writing
  - To be complete and thus not leave anything out; to not make a blank statement; at least they are trying to be right
  - building on past work (references)
- Can we be specific but write clearly?
  - Depends on the audience(?); considder your audence
    - ask questions about them
      - learn where they 're coming from/hang out/what they read/how they communicate
    - who is your demografic?
    - how to be a better writer by being a better reader
      - see below/reading section
      - Know why you are writing -> style
        - Do you wanna learn something or teach something
        - share/delight?
        - instruct/inform?
      - Exercise: write to a specific reader (1 person)
      - how to conclude a piece?
        - What is your thesis and goal?
        - What do I leave the reader with?
  - write stories/narrative
    - Is this possible in the current format? Journals, etc?

Plagiatism
- People often do not know or consider that other pieces of text do have an author (no references/attributions?)
- "ideas don't matter, exection does" -> moraly corrupt
- not critically engaging
- memes/tiktok are a good example 
  - plagiatism does not always count for art??? I don't agree

AI (non-human made text)
- vs plagiatism

# Reading
- where does this come from? (AI, human, Russia)
- who is the audience?
- what is the goal of this piece of text?
  - vs where this comes from and who the aucience is.
- read text completely; don't skip the end note that states
  - where the money is coming from
- Be nonreactive to other people's arguments??
  - learn to see logical fallacies from others (https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/search)
