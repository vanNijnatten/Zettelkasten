[[spirometry|Lung function]]. Normalised using [[gli|GLI-2012]] (UMCG) or [[nhanes|NHANES III]] normalization equations.

## Alveolar Volume
...

## DLco and TLco
Single-breath diffusion capacity of the lung, for the uptake of carbon monoxide (DLco, also known as transfer factor or transfer capacity, TLco)

## Kco
Transfer coefficient of the lung, for the update of carbon monoxide (Kco), is DLco corrected for alveolar volume.

# Research
  - [Baldi et al (2006)](https://dx.doi.org/10.2147%2Fcopd.2006.1.4.477) showed that bronchodilators do have an effect on DLco, but only at their highest dosis (salbutamol, 200-1000 Î¼g). It does not have an effect on Kco.
