# Methylation
To date, a number of methods have been developed to detect/quantify DNA methylation including: high-performance capillary electrophoresis (4) and methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR (5). However, the most common technique used today remains the bisulfite conversion method (6). This technique involves treating methylated DNA with bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosines into uracil. Methylated cytosines remain unchanged during the treatment. Once converted, the methylation profile of the DNA can be determined by PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing (see next page).
(spontaneous) deamination = cytosine => uracil. uracil-DNA glycosylase  is there to repair the DNA
5-methylcytosine => thymine. uracil-DNA glycosylase cannot repair the DNA. Mismatch repair (really inefficient) via thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG). Because of this inefficient mechanism, methylation is the most stable epigenetic marker.
CG suppression
cpg-island = at least 200 bp in length, GC% > 50%, Observed/Expected CpG ratio > 60%, tend to be unmethylated. (cpg islands tend to be in active regions with active genes as the cpgs are unmethylated - they are protected). 70% of human promotors have high percentages of cpgs
cpg sites are expected to occur in the genome at 6,...%, however only occur about 1%
SssI methylase, which globally methylates all double-stranded CpG sites
bisulfite conversion can fragment DNA ?

## Methylation methods
A number of methods have been developed to detect and quantify DNA methylation:
 - High-performance capillary electrophoresis [ref](#^ref1)
 - Methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR [ref][1]
 - Bisulfite conversion method (most common used technique)

DNA Methylation protocols almost always include a bisulfite processing step.
Unmethylated Cytosine will be transformed to Uracil during this process. Then during the PCR step, the Uracil will be transcribed as a Thymine. The methylated Cytosine (also known as 5-methylcytosine) will stay the same.
