# FN1 - fibronectin 1

## Summary
...

## Research
### No reference
- Two types of FN
  - soluble inactive plasma [[FN1|FN]] (plasma FN or pFN) ([[hepatocytes]], liver) [^ref1]
  - insoluble [[FN1|FN]] in [[extracellular matrices]] (cellular FN or cFN) ([[fibroblasts]], [[endothelial cells]], [[chondrocytes]], [[synovial cells]], [[myocytes]]) [^ref1] [^ref5]
  - cFN contains variable proportions of the alternatively spliced EDA and EDB sequences [^ref10]
  - pFN lacks the alternatively spliced EDA and EDB sequences [^ref10]
- [[FN1|FN]] adheres to cells through a [[dimeric membrane protein]], the [[integrin|FN receptor (integrins)]] (written by [^ref1] ) FN1 and variants bind to integrins, such as Œ±5Œ≤1 and Œ±vŒ≤3.
- FN and its receptor are important in lung development. Their coexpression coincides with the onset of [[lung|branching morphogenesis]] and is barely detectable in adult lung (what tissue type?). [^ref1]
- FN expression increases during injury and wound healing [^ref1]
- FN is regulated by [[cAMP]], [[TGF-b]], [[epidermal growth factor]], [[PDGF]], [[glucocorticosteroids]], [[vitamin D3]]) [^ref1]
- FN is a [[mesenchymal cell]] marker [^ref4]
- Expressed in [[Macrophages]], [[Fibroblasts]], [[Monocytes]], [[Smooth Muscle]] and [[Endothelial cells]] [^ref6_hca_epithelium]
- FN has different functional domains that directly bind it to a variety of molecules such as [[fibrin]], [[collagen]], and [[heparin]] [^ref10]
- 

### Homo Sapiens:
- [[SPARC]] activates stromal fibroblasts only in the presence of FN1  [^ref2] (Ishakawa [[cell-lines|cell line]])
- [[SPARC]] enhances [[FN1]] expression in [^ref7]
- FN is regulated by TGF-b [^ref3] and others (see above)
- salinomycin reduces the level of [[FN1]] [^ref8]
- _[[FN1]]_ has been shown to be decreased following Paraquat (PQ)‚Äêinduced¬†senescence in control fibroblasts grown in culture [^ref9]
