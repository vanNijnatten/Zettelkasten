# FN1 - fibronectin 1

## Summary
...

## Research
## Ideas
- FN1 interacts with Integrin Œ±5Œ≤1 (dimer complex)
- This comples interacts with CEACAM(1/6/8) https://apps.pathwaycommons.org/pathways?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fidentifiers.org%2Freactome%2FR-HSA-1566977
- Liogation of CD66b (CEACAM8) enhances adhesion to fibronectin [^ref12] in neutrophils. Neutros release of IL-8 in stimulation of CEACAM8. Nuetrophils are the first cells to migrate to infected tissue and use phagocytosis and degranulation.

- Two types of FN
  - soluble inactive plasma [[FN1|FN]] (plasma FN or pFN) ([[hepatocytes]], liver) [^ref1]
  - insoluble [[FN1|FN]] in [[extracellular matrices]] (cellular FN or cFN) ([[fibroblasts]], [[endothelial cells]], [[chondrocytes]], [[synovial cells]], [[myocytes]]) [^ref1] [^ref5]
  - cFN contains variable proportions of the alternatively spliced EDA and EDB sequences [^ref10]
  - pFN lacks the alternatively spliced EDA and EDB sequences [^ref10]
- [[FN1|FN]] adheres to cells through a hetro [[dimeric membrane protein]], the [[integrin|FN receptor (integrins)]] (written by [^ref1] ) [[FN1]] and variants(?) bind to [[integrin|integrins]], such as Œ±5Œ≤1 and Œ±vŒ≤3.
  - At least six integrins, as described by Hynes 1992; Vogel et al. 1990; Busk et al. 1992; Elices et al. 1991. quoted from [^ref15]
- Absence of [[FN1]] or absence of the function of [[FN1]] results in embryonic death. (quoted from [^ref15])
  - Cells are able to migrate using [[FN1]] despite absence of (function of) Œ±5Œ≤1 (quoted from [^ref15])
- [[FN1]] and its receptor are important in lung development. Their coexpression coincides with the onset of [[lung|branching morphogenesis]] and is barely detectable in adult lung (what tissue type?). [^ref1]
- [[FN]] expression increases during injury and wound healing [^ref1]
- [[FN]] is regulated by [[cAMP]], [[TGF-b]], [[epidermal growth factor]], [[PDGF]], [[glucocorticosteroids]], [[vitamin D3]]) [^ref1]
- [[FN]] is a [[mesenchymal cell]] marker [^ref4]
- Expressed in [[Macrophages]], [[Fibroblasts]], [[Monocytes]], [[Smooth Muscle]] and [[Endothelial cells]] [^ref6_hca_epithelium]
- FN has different functional domains that directly bind it to a variety of molecules such as [[fibrin]], [[collagen]], and [[heparin]] [^ref10]

### Homo Sapiens:
- [[SPARC]] activates stromal fibroblasts only in the presence of _[[FN1]]  [^ref2] (Ishakawa [[cell-lines|cell line]])
- [[SPARC]] enhances _[[FN1]]_ expression in [^ref7]
- FN is regulated by TGF-b [^ref3] and others (see above)
- salinomycin reduces the level of _[[FN1]]_ [^ref8]
- _[[FN1]]_ has been shown to be decreased following Paraquat (PQ)‚Äêinduced¬†senescence in control fibroblasts grown in culture [^ref9]
- High expression of [[FN1]] suppresses apoptosis through the [[NF-Œ∫B pathway]] and is associated with migration in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^ref13]
- Heparin-II domain of [[fibronectin]] is a vascular endothelial growth factor ([[VEGF]])-binding domain [^ref14]
  - [[FN1]] is neccessary for vascular growth, but is not dependent on integrin a5b1 - (Drake et al., 1992). However, a5b1-null phenotype results in destended and leaky blood vessels. Therefore a5b1 is neccessary for proper growth. Furthermore, FN1 and a5b1 are involved in erythropoiesis, though that process continues without a5b1. (to what extend?)[^ref15]
