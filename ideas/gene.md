# Interesting Genes
This is a list of interesting genes.

WNT - DKK1 -> Bone density?
CEACAM5? -> Spier distrofie? cell adhesie?
SERPINA1 -> emphysema in lung
NR3C1 -> glucocorticoid receptor
NR3C2 -> Mineralocorticoid receptor
NR3C3 -> Progesterone receptor
NR3C4 -> androgen receptor
AhR -> xenobiotic / smoking
nAChRs -> nicotine?
MAP2K1 -> Something with sex reversal 46XY-6
POSTN -> periostin, extracellular matrix protein, reflects airway epithelial injury, associated with Th2 driven inflammation and ICS response in asthma (10.1183/13993003.congress-2018.pa1074 , 10.1186/s12931-018-0818-8)
ALOX15 - ALOX15 encodes arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase. It is a lipoxygenase that can oxidize PUFAs to corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives. ALOX15 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). 15-HETE is further metabolized into various bioactive molecules. ALOX15 and its metabolites are important factors in the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD because of their role in the regulation of eosinophil-mediated inflammation, migration of immune, and airway remodeling (10.4168/aair.2021.13.5.684)
COL6A1 - collagen gene
MEX3D -- BCL2 (other gene)
BCL2 - apoptosis/autofagie

## VEGFA -  vascular endothelial growth factor-A
- Is a ligand for both _VEGFR1_ and _VEGFR2_.
- Blockage of the VEGF pathways was previously found to lead to more severe small airway remodelling in a rat model [^Wang2017].
- endothelial cell survival
- maintains angiogenesis
- involved in small airway remodelling
- alveolar destruction in COPD
- signalling pathway: COPD development & COPD phenotypes
- polymorphisms: lung cancer, changes in lung function
- expressed in tissue rich in blood vessels + inflammatory cells?? (Lu et all, 2016)
- inflammatory response in Lung (kaddha & Kulkarni, 2019)
- increased expression in exacerbation, not after exacerbation
- maintenance of endothelial cells & epithelial cells viability
- lose of VEGF led to endothelial cell apaptosis & disapperance of lung tissue (Soltani et all, 2016)



### Severe COPD paper
- We found less VEGFA in sCOPD compared to non-COPD
- An association with sCOPD
- We did not measure progression of disease

Corry-Anke:
    What would/could be the role of _VEGFA_ in epithelial cells in bronchus and nose and does it make sense that the expression of this gene is lower in sCOPD? If epithelial cells produce more/less _VEGFA_ how would this than affect its neighbouring cells that may express the receptors? How does it connect to the surroundings genes in the pathways, can they maybe form an explanation?

Maarten:
	Dit is toch niet logisch want precies tegengesteld. A) Blockage of VEGF leads to more small airway disease. And b) the lower expression of VEGFA means less protection.
    See attached manuscript. You can use that to write some more on the role of VEGFA in COPD. Very important to start making clear for yourself what message is. Then very clear explanation not only description of literature, but also what it exactly means in context of your findings.
        Our findings of reduced VEGFA expression in severe COPD are of interest. VEGFA is a key growth factor for building lung architecture. It was previously shown that loss of VEGFA leads to endothelial cell apoptosis and dissapearance of lung tissue in COPd, possibly due to reduced blood supply from small capillaries leading to loss of alveolar septa. Our findings support a role for VEGFA in development of sCOPD.
    Another gene of interest was fibronectin 1
