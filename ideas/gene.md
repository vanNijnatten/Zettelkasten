# Interesting Genes
This is a list of interesting genes.

WNT - DKK1 -> Bone density?
CEACAM5? -> Spier distrofie? cell adhesie?
SERPINA1 -> emphysema in lung
NR3C1 -> glucocorticoid receptor
NR3C2 -> Mineralocorticoid receptor
NR3C3 -> Progesterone receptor
NR3C4 -> androgen receptor
AhR -> xenobiotic / smoking
nAChRs -> nicotine?
MAP2K1 -> Something with sex reversal 46XY-6
POSTN -> periostin, extracellular matrix protein, reflects airway epithelial injury, associated with Th2 driven inflammation and ICS response in asthma (10.1183/13993003.congress-2018.pa1074 , 10.1186/s12931-018-0818-8)
ALOX15 - ALOX15 encodes arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase. It is a lipoxygenase that can oxidize PUFAs to corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives. ALOX15 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). 15-HETE is further metabolized into various bioactive molecules. ALOX15 and its metabolites are important factors in the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD because of their role in the regulation of eosinophil-mediated inflammation, migration of immune, and airway remodeling (10.4168/aair.2021.13.5.684)
COL6A1 - collagen gene
MEX3D -- BCL2 (other gene)
BCL2 - apoptosis/autofagie
[[VEGFA]]
[[FN1]]
SPARC - Matricellular glycoprotein, SPARC is a secreted molecule, that mediates the interaction between cells  and extracellular matrix. SPARC functions as a regulator of matrix organization and modulates cell behavior. Fibronectin mediates activation of stromal fibroblasts by SPARC in endometrial cancer cells.
