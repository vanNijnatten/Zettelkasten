  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global health problem. The etiology of COPD has been associated with apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. However, understanding of the molecular interactions that modulate COPD pathogenesis remains only partly resolved. We conducted an exploratory study on COPD etiology to identify the key molecular participants. We used information-theoretic algorithms including Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR), Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNE), and Inferelator. We captured direct functional associations among genes, given a compendium of gene expression profiles of human lung epithelial cells. A set of genes differentially expressed in COPD, as reported in a previous study were superposed with the resulting transcriptional regulatory networks. After factoring in the properties of the networks, an established COPD susceptibility locus and domaindomain interactions involving protein products of genes in the generated networks, several molecular candidates were predicted to be involved in the etiology of COPD. These include COL4A3, CFLAR, GULP1, PDCD1, CASP10, PAX3, BOK, HSPD1, PITX2, and PML. Furthermore, T-box (TBX) genes and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A), which are in a direct transcriptional regulatory relationship, emerged as preeminent participants in the etiology of COPD by means of senescence. Contrary to observations in neoplasms, our study reveals that the expression of genes and proteins in the lung samples from patients with COPD indicate an increased tendency towards cellular senescence. The expression of the antisenescence mediators TBX transcription factors, chromatin modifiers histone deacetylases, and sirtuins was suppressed; while the expression of TBX-regulated cellular senescence markers such as CDKN2A, CDKN1A, and CAV1 was elevated in the peripheral lung tissue samples from patients with COPD. The critical balance between senescence and anti-senescence factors is disrupted towards senescence in COPD lungs.},

  abstract = {In animals, systemic control of metabolism is conducted by metabolic tissues and relies on the regulated circulation of a plethora of molecules, such as hormones and lipoprotein complexes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of post-transcriptional gene repressors that are present throughout the animal kingdom and have been widely associated with the regulation of gene expression in various contexts, including virtually all aspects of systemic control of metabolism. Here we focus on glucose and lipid metabolism and review current knowledge of the role of miRNAs in their systemic regulation. We survey miRNA-mediated regulation of healthy metabolism as well as the contribution of miRNAs to metabolic dysfunction in disease, particularly diabetes, obesity and liver disease. Although most miRNAs act on the tissue they are produced in, it is now well established that miRNAs can also circulate in bodily fluids, including their intercellular transport by extracellular vesicles, and we discuss the role of such extracellular miRNAs in systemic metabolic control and as potential biomarkers of metabolic status and metabolic disease.},

  abstract = {The complex cellular heterogeneity of the lung poses a unique challenge to researchers in the field. While the use of bulk RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology in systems biology, the technique necessarily averages out individual contributions to the overall transcriptional landscape of a tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a robust, unbiased survey of the transcriptome comparable to bulk RNA sequencing while preserving information on cellular heterogeneity. In just a few years since this technology was developed, scRNA-seq has already been adopted widely in respiratory research and has contributed to impressive advancements such as the discoveries of the pulmonary ionocyte and of a profibrotic macrophage population in pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we discuss general technical considerations when considering the use of scRNA-seq and examine how leading investigators have applied the technology to gain novel insights into respiratory biology, from development to disease. In addition, we discuss the evolution of single-cell technologies with a focus on spatial and multi-omics approaches that promise to drive continued innovation in respiratory research.},

  abstract = {The factors that regulate thymic development of the CD4+ T cell gene program remain poorly defined. The transcriptional regulator ThPOK is a dominant factor in CD4+ T cell development, which functions primarily to repress the CD8 lineage fate. Previously, we showed that nuclear protein TOX is also required for murine CD4+ T cell development. Here we sought to investigate if the requirement for TOX was solely due to a role in ThPOK induction. In apparent support of this proposition, ThPOK upregulation and CD8 lineage repression were compromised in the absence of TOX, and enforced ThPOK expression could restore some CD4 development. However, these “rescued” CD4 cells were defective in many aspects of the CD4+ T cell gene program, including expression of Id2, Foxo1, and endogenous Thpok, among others. Thus, TOX is necessary to establish the CD4+ T cell lineage gene program, independent of its influence on ThPOK expression.},

Knowing cell-type proportions in a tissue is very important to identify which cells or cell types are targeted by a disease or perturbation. When measuring such responses using RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq masks cellular heterogeneity. Hence, several computational methods have been proposed to infer cell-type proportions from bulk RNA samples. Their performance with noisy reference profiles highly depends on the set of genes undergoing deconvolution. These genes are often selected based on prior knowledge or a single-criterion test that might not be useful to dissect closely correlated cell types. In this work, we introduce             AutoGeneS             , a tool that automatically extracts informative genes and reveals the cellular heterogeneity of bulk RNA samples. AutoGeneS requires no prior knowledge about marker genes and selects genes by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria: minimizing the correlation and maximizing the distance between cell types. It can be applied to reference profiles from various sources like single-cell experiments or sorted cell populations. Results from human samples of peripheral blood illustrate that AutoGeneS outperforms other methods. Our results also highlight the impact of our approach on analyzing bulk RNA samples with noisy single-cell reference profiles and closely correlated cell types. Ground truth cell proportions analyzed by flow cytometry confirmed the accuracy of the predictions of AutoGeneS in identifying cell-type proportions. AutoGeneS is available for use via a standalone Python package (             https://github.com/theislab/AutoGeneS             ).},

  abstract = {Abstract In contrast to studies focused on cigarette smoking and risk of breast cancer occurrence, this study explored the influence of smoking on breast cancer recurrence and progression. The goal was to evaluate the interaction between smoking history and gene expression levels on recurrence and overall survival of breast cancer patients. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fitted for 48 cigarette smokers, 50 non-smokers, and the total population separately to determine which gene expressions and gene expression/cigarette usage interaction terms were significant in predicting overall and diseasefree survival in breast cancer patients. Using methods similar to Andres et al. (BMC Cancer 13:326, 2013a; Horm Cancer 4:208–221, 2013b), multivariable analyses revealed CENPN, CETN1, CYP1A1, IRF2, LECT2, and NCOA1 to be important predictors for both breast carcinoma recurrence and mortality among smokers. Additionally, COMT was important for recurrence, and NAT1 and RIPK1 were important for mortality. In contrast, only IRF2, CETN1, and CYP1A1 were significant for disease recurrence and mortality among non-smokers, with NAT2 additionally significant for survival. Analysis of interaction between smoking status and gene expression values using the combined samples revealed significant interactions between smoking status and CYP1A1, LECT2, and CETN1. Signatures consisting of 7–8 genes were highly predictive for breast cancer recurrence and overall survival among smokers, with median C-index values of 0.8 and 0.73 for overall survival and recurrence, respectively. In contrast, median C-index values for non-smokers was only 0.59. Hence, significant interactions between gene expression and smoking status can play a key role in predicting breast cancer patient outcomes.},

The two pegRNAs template the synthesis of complementary DNA flaps on opposing strands of genomic DNA, which replace the endogenous DNA sequence between the prime-editor-induced nick sites. When combined with a site-specific serine recombinase, twinPE enabled targeted integration of gene-sized DNA plasmids ({$>$}5,000 bp) and targeted sequence inversions of 40 kb in human cells. TwinPE expands the capabilities of precision gene editing and might synergize with other tools for the correction or complementation of large or complex human pathogenic alleles.},

Although less comprehensive than high-throughput sequencing-based techniques, this product is more cost-effective and promises to be the most widely used DNAm high-throughput measurement technology over the next several years. Results: Here we describe a suite of computational tools that incorporate state-of-the-art statistical techniques for the analysis of DNAm data. The software is structured to easily adapt to future versions of the technology. We include methods for preprocessing, quality assessment and detection of differentially methylated regions from the kilobase to the megabase scale. We show how our software provides a powerful and flexible development platform for future methods. We also illustrate how our methods empower the technology to make discoveries previously thought to be possible only with sequencingbased methods.},

However, an evaluation of the impact of data transformation, pre-processing, marker selection, cell type composition and choice of methodology on the deconvolution results is still lacking. Using five single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, we generate pseudo-bulk mixtures to evaluate the combined impact of these factors. Both bulk deconvolution methodologies and those that use scRNA-seq data as reference perform best when applied to data in linear scale and the choice of normalization has a dramatic impact on some, but not all methods. Overall, methods that use scRNA-seq data have comparable performance to the best performing bulk methods whereas semi-supervised approaches show higher error values. Moreover, failure to include cell types in the reference that are present in a mixture leads to substantially worse results, regardless of the previous choices. Altogether, we evaluate the combined impact of factors affecting the deconvolution task across different datasets and propose general guidelines to maximize its performance.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Recently, activation of the WNT/b-catenin pathway has been associated with abnormal ECM turnover in various chronic diseases. We determined WNT-pathway gene expression in pulmonary fibroblasts of individuals with and without COPD and disentangled the role of b-catenin in fibroblast phenotype and function. Methods: We assessed the expression of WNT-pathway genes and the functional role of b-catenin, using MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts and primary pulmonary fibroblasts of individuals with and without COPD. Results:Pulmonary fibroblasts expressed mRNA of genes required for WNT signaling. Stimulation of fibroblasts with TGF-b1, a growth factor important in COPD pathogenesis, induced WNT-5B, FZD8, DVL3 and b-catenin mRNA expression. The induction of WNT-5B, FZD6, FZD8 and DVL3 mRNA by TGF-b1 was higher in fibroblasts of individuals with COPD than without COPD, whilst basal expression was similar. Accordingly, TGF-b1 activated b-catenin signaling, as shown by an increase in transcriptionally active and total b-catenin protein expression. Furthermore, TGF-b1 induced the expression of collagen1a1, a-sm-actin and fibronectin, which was attenuated by b-catenin specific siRNA and by pharmacological inhibition of b-catenin, whereas the TGF-b1-induced expression of PAI-1 was not affected. The induction of transcriptionally active b-catenin and subsequent fibronectin deposition induced by TGF-b1 were enhanced in pulmonary fibroblasts from individuals with COPD. Conclusions: b-catenin signaling contributes to ECM production by pulmonary fibroblasts and contributes to myofibroblasts differentiation. WNT/b-catenin pathway expression and activation by TGF-b1 is enhanced in pulmonary fibroblasts from individuals with COPD. This suggests an important role of the WNT/b-catenin pathway in regulating fibroblast phenotype and function in COPD.},

Since 1994, scientists have competed in the biannual Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) protein-folding challenge. Deep learning methods took center stage at CASP14, with DeepMind’s Alphafold2 achieving remarkable accuracy. Baek               et al               . explored network architectures based on the DeepMind framework. They used a three-track network to process sequence, distance, and coordinate information simultaneously and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. The method, RoseTTA fold, can solve challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy modeling problems and generate accurate models of protein-protein complexes. —VV                        ,              Protein structure modeling enables the rapid solution of protein structures and provides insights into function.           ,              DeepMind presented notably accurate predictions at the recent 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP14) conference. We explored network architectures that incorporate related ideas and obtained the best performance with a three-track network in which information at the one-dimensional (1D) sequence level, the 2D distance map level, and the 3D coordinate level is successively transformed and integrated. The three-track network produces structure predictions with accuracies approaching those of DeepMind in CASP14, enables the rapid solution of challenging x-ray crystallography and cryo–electron microscopy structure modeling problems, and provides insights into the functions of proteins of currently unknown structure. The network also enables rapid generation of accurate protein-protein complex models from sequence information alone, short-circuiting traditional approaches that require modeling of individual subunits followed by docking. We make the method available to the scientific community to speed biological research.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been extensively studied, especially in Western Europe and North America. Few of these data are directly comparable because of differences between the surveys regarding composition of study populations, diagnostic criteria of the disease and definitions of the risk factors. Few community studies have examined phenotypes of COPD and included other ways of characterising the disease beyond that of spirometry. The objective of the present Task Force report is to present recommendations for the performance of general population studies in COPD in order to facilitate comparable and valid estimates on COPD prevalence by various risk factors. Diagnostic criteria in epidemiological settings, and standardised methods to examine the disease and its potential risk factors are discussed. The paper also offers practical advice for planning and performing an epidemiological study on COPD. The main message of the paper is that thorough planning is worth half the study. It is crucial to stick to standardised methods and good quality control during sampling. We recommend collecting biological markers, depending on the specific objectives of the study. Finally, studies of COPD in the population at large should assess various phenotypes of the disease.},

Spirometry and DLCO were measured before and after cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol (from 200 μg to 1000 μg). Salbutamol caused significant increments of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and flows at 30\% of control FVC taken from both partial and maximal forced expiratory maneuvers. Functional residual capacity and residual volume were reduced, while total lung capacity did not change significantly. DLCO increased progressively with the incremental doses of salbutamol, but this became significant only at the highest dose (1000 μg) and was independent of the extent of emphysema, as assessed by radiological parameters. No significant changes were observed in CO transfer factor (DLCO/VA) and alveolar volume (VA). The results suggest that changes in lung function induced by cumulative doses of inhaled salbutamol are associated with a slight but significant increase in DLCO irrespective of the presence and extent of emphysema.},

  abstract = {COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) together represent a considerable unmet medical need, and advances in their treatment lag well behind those of other chronic conditions. Both diseases involve maladaptive repair mechanisms leading to progressive and irreversible damage. However, our understanding of the complex underlying disease mechanisms is incomplete; with current diagnostic approaches, COPD and IPF are often discovered at an advanced stage and existing definitions of COPD and IPF can be misleading. To halt or reverse disease progression and achieve lung regeneration, there is a need for earlier identification and treatment of these diseases. A precision medicine approach to treatment is also important, involving the recognition of disease subtypes, or endotypes, according to underlying disease mechanisms, rather than the current “one-size-fits-all” approach. This review is based on discussions at a meeting involving 38 leading global experts in chronic lung disease mechanisms, and describes advances in the understanding of the pathology and molecular mechanisms of COPD and IPF to identify potential targets for reversing disease degeneration and promoting tissue repair and lung regeneration. We also discuss limitations of existing disease measures, technical advances in understanding disease pathology, and novel methods for targeted drug delivery.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is regarded as a disease of accelerated lung aging. This affliction shows all of the hallmarks of aging, including telomere shortening, cellular senescence, activation of PI3 kinase-mTOR signaling, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, stem cell exhaustion, epigenetic changes, abnormal microRNA profiles, immunosenescence, and a low-grade chronic inflammation (inflammaging). Many of these pathways are driven by chronic exogenous and endogenous oxidative stress. There is also a reduction in antiaging molecules, such as sirtuins and Klotho, which further accelerate the aging process. COPD is associated with several comorbidities (multimorbidity), such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, that share the same pathways of accelerated aging. Understanding these mechanisms has helped identify several novel therapeutic targets, and several drugs and dietary interventions are now in development to treat multimorbidity.},

Several mutations within the SERPINA1 gene have been found to cause this deficiency. The most common variants are PI*Z and PI*S, each caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We describe a real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the rapid genotyping of these polymorphisms. DNA was extracted from fourteen EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood samples using the Qiagen EZ1 blood extraction kit. SNP genotyping was performed using primer/probe sets purchased from Applied Biosystems. These were evaluated for performance and assay conditions on the Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST System. The genotypes of these samples were compared with their phenotype results from isoelectric focusing assays, which were performed by an independent reference laboratory. In addition, twenty samples that were previously genotyped at another laboratory were obtained for accuracy studies. Thirty-four samples were tested; five genotypes were represented and the assay was able to discriminate these successfully. Only one genotype could not be correlated with its phenotype result, as the phenotype was reported as an "unidentified allele". All other genotyping results were concordant with previously determined genotypes and phenotypes. We describe a rapid real time PCR assay that is suitable for clinical use in genotyping AAT alleles and which can be used as the initial step in A1AT testing algorithms.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Inflammation is a core feature of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. It is important to focus on inflammation since it gives insight into the pathological changes causing an exacerbation, thereby possibly providing directions for future therapies which modify inflammation. Objectives: To provide a cell-by-cell overview of the inflammatory processes during COPD exacerbations. To evaluate cell activation, and cytokine production, cellular interactions, damaging effects of inflammatory mediators to tissue, and the relation to symptoms at the onset of COPD exacerbations. To speculate on future therapeutic options to modify inflammation during COPD exacerbations. Results: During COPD exacerbations, there is increased airway wall inflammation, with pathophysiological influx of eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Although links have been suggested between the increase in eosinophils and lymphocytes and a viral etiology of the exacerbation, and between the increase in neutrophils and a bacterial aetiology, these increases in both inflammatory cell types are not limited to the respective aetiologies and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Conclusion: Further research is required to fully understand the inflammatory mechanisms in the onset and development of COPD exacerbations. This might make inflammatory pathway-specific intervention possible, resulting in a more effective treatment of COPD exacerbations with fewer side effects.},

The role of               NRF2               in pulmonary neoplasia, a diverse disease for which few biomarkers exist, is complicated and appears to depend on several main factors including the existence of activating mutations in               NRF2               and/or loss of function mutations in               KEAP1               and the stage of carcinogenesis studied, particularly in the mouse models tested.

  abstract = {Abstract Generating mature, differentiated, adult lung cells from pluripotent cells, such as induced pluripotent stem cells and embryonic stem cells, offers the hope of both generating disease-specific in vitro models and creating definitive and personalized therapies for a host of debilitating lung parenchymal and airway diseases. With the goal of advancing lung-regenerative medicine, several groups have developed and reported on protocols using defined media, coculture with mesenchymal components, or sequential treatments mimicking lung development, to obtain distal lung epithelial cells from stem cell precursors. However, there remains significant controversy about the degree of differentiation of these cells compared with their primary counterparts, coupled with a lack of consistency or uniformity in assessing the resultant phenotypes. Given the inevitable, exponential expansion of these approaches and the probable, but yet-to-emerge second and higher generation techniques to create such assets, we were prompted to pose the question, what makes a lung epithelial cell a lung epithelial cell? More specifically for this Perspective, we also posed the question, what are the minimum features that constitute an alveolar type (AT) 2 epithelial cell? In addressing this, we summarize a body of work spanning nearly five decades, amassed by a series of “lung epithelial cell biology pioneers,” which carefully describes well characterized molecular, functional, and morphological features critical for discriminately assessing an AT2 phenotype. Armed with this, we propose a series of core criteria to assist the field in confirming that cells obtained following a differentiation protocol are indeed mature and functional AT2 epithelial cells.},

Here, we develop a high-throughput sequencing protocol that efficiently captures small RNAs while minimizing inherent biases associated with library production. The protocol is based on early barcoding such that all downstream manipulations can be performed on a pool of many samples thereby reducing reagent usage and workload. We show that the optimization of adapter concentrations along with the addition of nucleotide modifications and random nucleotides increases the efficiency of small RNA capture. We further show, using unique molecular identifiers, that stochastic capture of low input RNA rather than PCR amplification influences the biased quantitation of intermediately and lowly expressed microRNAs. Our improved method allows the processing of tens to hundreds of samples simultaneously while retaining high efficiency quantitation of microRNAs in low input samples from tissues or bodily fluids.},

  abstract = {Aims: Bisulfite sequence analysis of individual CpG sites within genomic DNA is a powerful approach for methylation analysis in the genome. The major limitation of bisulfite-based methods is parallelization. Both array and next-generation sequencing technology are capable of addressing this bottleneck. In this report, we describe the application of Infinium               ®               genotyping technology to analyze bisulfite-converted DNA to simultaneously query the methylation state of over 27,000 CpG sites from promoters of consensus coding sequences (CCDS) genes. Materials \& methods: We adapted the Infinium genotyping assay to readout an array of over 27,000 pairs of CpG methylation-specific query probes complementary to bisulfite-converted DNA. Two probes were designed to each CpG site: a ‘methylated’ and an ‘unmethylated’ query probe. The probe design assumed that all underlying CpG sites were ‘in phase’ with the queried CpG site due to their close proximity. Bisulfite conversion was performed with a modified version of the Zymo EZ DNA Methylation™ kit. Results: We applied this technology to measuring methylation levels across a panel of 14 different human tissues, four Coriell cell lines and six cancer cell lines. We observed that CpG sites within CpG islands (CGIs) were largely unmethylated across all tissues (∼80\% sites unmethylated, β {$<$} 0.2), whereas CpG sites in non-CGIs were moderately to highly methylated (only ∼12\% sites unmethylated, β {$<$} 0.2). Within CGIs, only approximately 3–6\% of the loci were highly methylated; in contrast, outside of CGIs approximately 25–40\% of loci were highly methylated. Moreover, tissue-specific methylation (variation in methylation across tissues) was much more prevalent in non-CGIs than within CGIs. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a genome-wide scalable array-based methylation readout platform that is both highly reproducible and quantitative. In the near future, this platform should enable the analysis of hundreds of thousands to millions of CpG sites per sample.},

  abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and lethal disease of unknown etiology and uncertain pathogenic mechanisms. Recent studies indicate that the pathogenesis of the disease may involve the abnormal expression of certain developmental pathways. Here we evaluated the expression of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Patched-1, Smoothened, and transcription factors glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI)1 and GLI2 by RT-PCR, as well as their localization in IPF and normal lungs by immunohistochemistry. The effects of SHH on fibroblast proliferation, migration, collagen and fibronectin production, and apoptosis were analyzed by WST-1, Boyden chamber chemotaxis, RT-PCR, Sircol, and annexin V-propidium iodide binding assays, respectively. Our results showed that all the main components of the Sonic signaling pathway were overexpressed in IPF lungs. With the exception of Smoothened, they were also upregulated in IPF fibroblasts. SHH and GLI2 localized to epithelial cells, whereas Patched-1, Smoothened, and GLI1 were observed mainly in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells. No staining was detected in normal lungs. Recombinant SHH increased fibroblast proliferation ( P {$<$} 0.05), collagen synthesis, (2.5 ± 0.2 vs. 4.5 ± 1.0 μg of collagen/ml; P {$<$} 0.05), fibronectin expression (2–3-fold over control), and migration (190.3 ± 12.4\% over control, P {$<$} 0.05). No effect was observed on α-smooth muscle actin expression. SHH protected lung fibroblasts from TNF-α/IFN-γ/Fas-induced apoptosis (14.5 ± 3.2\% vs. 37.3 ± 7.2\%, P {$<$} 0.0001). This protection was accompanied by modifications in several apoptosis-related proteins, including increased expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. These findings indicate that the SHH pathway is activated in IPF lungs and that SHH may contribute to IPF pathogenesis by increasing the proliferation, migration, extracellular matrix production, and survival of fibroblasts.},

Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for COPD. However, relevant information from the literature published within the last years, either on general population samples or on workplaces, indicate that about 15\% of all cases of COPD is work-related. Specific settings and agents are quoted which have been indicated or confirmed as linked to COPD. Coal miners, hard-rock miners, tunnel workers, concrete-manufacturing workers, nonmining industrial workers have been shown to be at highest risk for developing COPD. Further evidence that occupational agents are capable of inducing COPD comes from experimental studies, particularly in animal models. In conclusion, occupational exposure to dusts, chemicals, gases should be considered an established, or supported by good evidence, risk factor for developing COPD. The implications of this substantial occupational contribution to COPD must be considered in research planning, in public policy decision-making, and in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Nasal gene expression profiling is a promising method to characterize COPD non-invasively. We aimed to identify a nasal gene expression profile to distinguish COPD patients from healthy controls. We investigated whether this COPD-associated gene expression profile in nasal epithelium is comparable with the profile observed in bronchial epithelium. Methods: Genome wide gene expression analysis was performed on nasal epithelial brushes of 31 severe COPD patients and 22 controls, all current smokers, using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. We repeated the gene expression analysis on bronchial epithelial brushes in 2 independent cohorts of mild-to-moderate COPD patients and controls. Results: In nasal epithelium, 135 genes were significantly differentially expressed between severe COPD patients and controls, 21 being up- and 114 downregulated in COPD (false discovery rate {$<$} 0.01). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed significant concordant enrichment of COPD-associated nasal and bronchial gene expression in both independent cohorts (FDRGSEA {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: We identified a nasal gene expression profile that differentiates severe COPD patients from controls. Of interest, part of the nasal gene expression changes in COPD mimics differentially expressed genes in the bronchus. These findings indicate that nasal gene expression profiling is potentially useful as a non-invasive biomarker in COPD.

  abstract = {Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, incurable lung disease characterised by abnormal tissue repair causing emphysema and small airways fibrosis. Since current therapy cannot modify this abnormal repair, it is crucial to unravel its underlying molecular mechanisms. Unbiased analysis of genome-wide gene expression profiles in lung tissue provides a powerful tool to investigate this. Methods We performed genome-wide gene expression profiling in 581 lung tissue samples from current and ex-smokers with (n=311) and without COPD (n=270). Subsequently, quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to validate our main findings. Results 112 genes were found to be upregulated in patients with COPD compared with controls, whereas 61 genes were downregulated. Among the most upregulated genes were fibulin-5 (FBLN5), elastin (ELN), latent transforming growth factor β binding protein 2 (LTBP2) and microfibrillar associated protein 4 (MFAP4), all implicated in elastogenesis. Our gene expression findings were validated at mRNA and protein level. We demonstrated higher ELN gene expression in COPD lung tissue and similar trends for FBLN5 and MFAP4, and negative correlations with lung function. FBLN5 protein levels were increased in COPD lung tissue and cleaved, possibly non-functional FBLN5 protein was present. Strong coexpression of FBLN5, ELN, LTBP2 and MFAP4 in lung tissue and in silico analysis indicated cofunctionality of these genes. Finally, colocalisation of FBLN5, MFAP4 and LTBP2 with elastic fibres was demonstrated in lung tissue. Conclusions We identified a clear gene signature for elastogenesis in COPD and propose FBLN5 as a novel player in tissue repair in COPD.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing prevalence, in particular in the elderly. COPD is characterised by abnormal tissue repair resulting in (small) airways disease and emphysema. There is accumulating evidence that ageing hallmarks are prominent features of COPD. These ageing hallmarks have been described in different subsets of COPD patients, in different lung compartments and also in a variety of cell types, and thus might contribute to different COPD phenotypes. A better understanding of the main differences and similarities between normal lung ageing and the pathology of COPD may improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving COPD pathology, in particular in those patients that develop the most severe form of COPD at a relatively young age,               i.e.               severe early-onset COPD patients.                          In this review, after introducing the main concepts of lung ageing and COPD pathology, we focus on the role of (abnormal) ageing in lung remodelling and repair in COPD. We discuss the current evidence for the involvement of ageing hallmarks in these pathological features of COPD. We also highlight potential novel treatment strategies and opportunities for future research based on our current knowledge of abnormal lung ageing in COPD.},

  abstract = {Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance can occur in a number of diseases. It can be either generalized (i.e., familial glucocorticoid resistance) or localized (i.e., asthma). In many cases, a reason for this resistance to steroids lies with mutations or polymorphisms present in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (GR/NR3C1) that belongs to a large family of nuclear receptors. A number of GC-resistant cell lines have been isolated in vitro, some of which arose or may have arisen in vivo. These and the mutations defined in them are included in this review as well as mutations engineered in plasmids and expressed in vitro. It also lists polymorphisms and the individual studies where association-related studies have been performed. NR3C1 is located on chromosome 5q31 and contains 10 exons that code for a 777 amino acid protein. There are two naturally occurring isoforms of the NR3C1, GRa (functional) and GRb (no hormonebinding ability). A total of 15 missense, three nonsense, three frameshift, one splice site, and two alternative spliced mutations have been reported in the NR3C1 gene associated with glucocorticoid resistance as well as 16 polymorphisms. Mutation and polymorphism data for NR3C1 will soon be found on the newly created locus-specific database.},

  abstract = {Background: As it is unknown whether complete asthma remission or progression of asthma is associated with airway inflammation and remodeling, we assessed these characteristics in bronchial biopsies of relevant subsets of asthma patients. Methods: Sputum and bronchial biopsies were obtained from asthma patients in remission (PC20 histamine {$>$} 32 mg/ml, PC20 AMP {$>$} 320 mg/ml) and from those with either a slow FEV1 decline ({$<$}30 ml/year) or fast decline ({$>$}30 ml/year). Inflammatory cells and mediators were determined in sputum, inflammatory cells and aspects of airway remodeling in bronchial biopsies. Results: Asthmatics in remission and asthma patients with a slow FEV1 decline had a similar extent of airway inflammation and remodeling in sputum and bronchial biopsies. Asthma patients with a fast FEV1 decline had high sputum eosinophil numbers. Moreover, FEV1 decline (ml/year) correlated with sputum eosinophil numbers (Rs Z 0.51, p Z 0.003) and ECP levels (Rs Z 0.57, p Z 0.001). Airway remodeling, i.e. basement membrane thickness, correlated with sputum eosinophils (Rs Z 0.69, p {$<$} 0.001), sputum ECP (Rs Z 0.46, p Z 0.018) and airway wall eosinophil numbers (Rs Z 0.49, p Z 0.002). Conclusions: Asthma, even when in remission, is accompanied by airway inflammation and remodeling. Data suggest that eosinophils are important in a subset of asthma patients by association to accelerated FEV1 decline and change of basement membrane thickness.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Smoking has detrimental effects on asthma outcome, such as increased cough, wheezing, sputum production, and frequency of asthma attacks. This results in accelerated lung function decline. The underlying pathological process of smoke-induced deterioration of asthma is unknown. Objectives: To compare bronchial inflammation and remodeling in never-smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers with asthma. Methods: A total of 147 patients with asthma (66 never-smokers, 46 ex-smokers, and 35 current smokers) were investigated. Measurements and Main Results: Lung function, exhaled nitric oxide levels, and symptom questionnaires were assessed, and induced sputum and bronchial biopsies were obtained for determination of airway inflammation and remodeling. Smokers with asthma had lower FEV1 and alveolar and bronchial nitric oxide levels than neversmokers. Smokers also had more goblet cells and mucus-positive epithelium, increased epithelial thickness, and a higher proliferation rate of intact and basal epithelium than ex-smokers and neversmokers. Smokers had higher numbers of mast cells and lower numbers of eosinophils than never-smokers. Ex-smokers had similar goblet cell numbers and mucus-positive epithelium, epithelial thickness, epithelial proliferation rate, and mast cell numbers as neversmokers. Conclusions: Smokers with asthma have epithelial changes that are associated with increased asthma symptoms, such as shortness of breath and phlegm production. The fact that epithelial characteristics in ex-smokers are similar to those in never-smokers suggests that the smoke-induced changes can be reversed by smoking cessation.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Individuals with asthma may outgrow symptoms despite not using treatment, whereas others reach complete remission (CoR) with absence of airway obstruction and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. It is uncertain whether this associates with remission of all inflammatory and remodeling asthma features. Objectives: To compare the pathologic phenotype of individuals with asthma with CoR and clinical remission (ClinR) and those with active asthma, with and without the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Methods: We investigated 165 individuals known with active asthma, on reexamination having CoR (n 5 18), ClinR (n 5 44), and current asthma (CuA, n 5 103, 64 with and 39 without ICS). Measurements Main Results: Inflammatory cells were measured in blood, induced sputum, and bronchial biopsies; histamine and ECP in sputum; and eosinophilic peroxidase (EPX) immunopositivity and remodeling (epithelial changes, E-cadherin expression, basement membrane [BM] thickening, collagen deposition) in bronchial biopsies. Median (range) blood eosinophils from CoR were significantly lower than those from CuA (0.10 [0.04–0.24] vs. 0.18 [0.02–1.16] 3 109/L). Bronchial EPX immunopositivity was lower in CoR than in both ClinR and CuA (67 [0.5–462] vs. 95 [8–5329] and 172 [6–5313] pixels). Other inflammatory findings were comparable. BM thickness was lowest in CuA, caused by lower BM thickness in those using ICS (CoR, 6.3 [4.7–8.4]; ClinR, 6.5 [3.8–11.7]; CuA, 5.7 [2.8–12.6]; and ICS using CuA, 5.3 [2.8–8.2] mm). Conclusions: CoR is still accompanied by airway abnormalities because BM thickness is similar in individuals with asthma with CoR, ClinR, and CuA without ICS. Airway eosinophilic activation best differentiates these three groups, signifying their importance in the clinical expression and severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma.},

  abstract = {Inflammation is a main pathogenetic factor in the development and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recently, it has become clear that not only the innate, but also the specific immune response plays a role. A striking finding, in particular in lungs of patients with severe COPD, often with a predominant emphysema phenotype, is the presence of B-cell follicles. As seen in other tissues, these follicles are the result of lymphoid neogenesis. The finding of oligoclonality in B-cell follicles in COPD suggests that they play a role in local antigen specific immune responses. To date, it is not known which antigens may be involved; microbial antigens, cigarette smoke-derived antigens and antigens from extracellular matrix breakdown products have been suggested. Consequently, the pathogenetic role of this follicular B-cell response is not yet clear. It might be protective against microbial colonisation and infection of the lower respiratory tract and, therefore, beneficial, or it could be of a more harmful (autoimmune) nature, directed against lung tissue components. It is necessary to determine the specific antigen(s) and to explore the exact role of the COPD related B-cell response in order to include modulation of this response and develop therapeutic options.},

Method We searched the Web of Science and PubMed databases to find studies addressing ethical problems in biobanks with no limits set (study design, study population, time period, or language of publication). All identified articles published until November 2010 were included. We analyzed the type of published articles, journals publishing them, involvement of countries/institutions, year of publication, and citations received, and qualitatively assessed every article in order to identify ethical issues addressed by the majority of published research on human biobanking. Results Hundred and fifty four studies satisfied our review criteria. The studies mainly came from highly developed countries and were all published in the last two decades, with over half of them published in 2009 or 2010. They most commonly discussed the informed consent, privacy and identifiability, return of results to participants, importance of public trust, involvement of children, commercialization, the role of ethics boards, international data exchange, ownership of samples, and benefit sharing. Conclusions The focus on ethical aspects is strongly present through the whole biobanking research field. Although there is a consensus on the old and most typical ethical issues, with further development of the field and increasingly complex structure of human biobanks, these issues will likely continue to arise and accumulate, hence requiring constant re-appraisal and continuing discussion.},

The aims of the seminar were to identify important questions related to small airways involvement in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and to discuss future approaches based on current and evolving knowledge. Data obtained by pathological and physiological measurements in small airways and their relevance to clinical manifestations and therapeutics in asthma and COPD were reviewed. It was concluded that our knowledge on the roles of small airways in asthma and COPD is limited. Studies of large numbers of well-characterised subjects using multiple methods (genetic characterisation, cell biology and physiology, imaging) and integration of the data using mathematical models are suggested to be of interest. The availability of these techniques coupled with our ability to better target inhaled molecules to small airways provide a unique opportunity for a reappraisal of the relevance of small airways in chronic airway diseases.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: This review is the summary of a workshop on the role of distal airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which took place in 2009 in Vence, France. The evidence showing inflammation and remodelling in distal airways and the possible involvement of these in the pathobiology, physiology, clinical manifestations and natural history of COPD were examined. The usefulness and limitations of physiological tests and imaging techniques for assessing distal airways abnormalities were evaluated. Ex vivo studies in isolated lungs and invasive measurements of airway resistance in living individuals have revealed that distal airways represent the main site of airflow limitation in COPD. Structural changes in small conducting airways, including increased wall thickness and obstruction by muco-inflammatory exudates, and emphysema (resulting in premature airway closure), were important determinants of airflow limitation. Infiltration of small conducting airways by phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils), dendritic cells and T and B lymphocytes increased with airflow limitation. Distal airways abnormalities were associated with patient-related outcomes (e.g. dyspnoea and reduced health-related quality of life) and with the natural history of the disease, as reflected by lung function decline and mortality. These data provide a clear rationale for targeting distal airways in COPD.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by nonreversible proximal bronchial obstruction leading to major respiratory disability. However, patient phenotypes better capture the heterogeneously reported complaints and symptoms of COPD. Recent studies provided evidence that classical bronchial obstruction does not properly reflect respiratory disability, and symptoms now form the new paradigm for assessment of disease severity and guidance of therapeutic strategies. The aim of this review was to explore pathways addressing COPD pathogenesis beyond proximal bronchial obstruction and to highlight innovative and promising tools for phenotyping and bedside assessment.             Distal small airways imaging allows quantitative characterisation of emphysema and functional air trapping. Micro-computed tomography and parametric response mapping suggest small airways disease precedes emphysema destruction. Small airways can be assessed functionally using nitrogen washout, probing ventilation at conductive or acinar levels, and forced oscillation technique. These tests may better correlate with respiratory symptoms and may well capture bronchodilation effects beyond proximal obstruction.             Knowledge of inflammation-based processes has not provided well-identified targets so far, and eosinophils probably play a minor role. Adaptative immunity or specific small airways secretory protein may provide new therapeutic targets. Pulmonary vasculature is involved in emphysema through capillary loss, microvascular lesions or hypoxia-induced remodelling, thereby impacting respiratory disability.},

  abstract = {Background: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) results from mutations in the SERPINA1 gene and classically presents with early-onset emphysema and liver disease. The most common mutation presenting with clinical evidence is the Z mutation, while the S mutation is associated with a milder plasma deficiency. AATD is an underdiagnosed condition and the World Health Organisation recommends targeted detection programmes for AATD in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), non-responsive asthma, cryptogenic liver disease and first degree relatives of known AATD patients. Methods: We present data from the first 3,000 individuals screened following ATS/ERS guidelines as part of the Irish National Targeted Detection Programme (INTDP). We also investigated a DNA collection of 1,100 individuals randomly sampled from the general population. Serum and DNA was collected from both groups and mutations in the SERPINA1 gene detected by phenotyping or genotyping. Results: The Irish National Targeted Detection Programme identified 42 ZZ, 44 SZ, 14 SS, 430 MZ, 263 MS, 20 IX and 2 rare mutations. Analysis of 1,100 randomly selected individuals identified 113 MS, 46 MZ, 2 SS and 2 SZ genotypes. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that AATD in Ireland is more prevalent than previously estimated with Z and S allele frequencies among the highest in the world. Furthermore, our targeted detection programme enriched the population of those carrying the Z but not the S allele, suggesting the Z allele is more important in the pathogenesis of those conditions targeted by the detection programme.},

  abstract = {Abstract | Single-cell sequencing-based methods for profiling gene transcript levels have revealed substantial heterogeneity in expression levels among morphologically indistinguishable cells. This variability has important functional implications for tissue biology and disease states such as cancer. Mapping of epigenomic information such as chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning, histone tail modifications and enhancer–promoter interactions in both bulk-cell and single-cell samples has shown that these characteristics of chromatin state contribute to expression or repression of associated genes. Advances in single-cell epigenomic profiling methods are enabling high-resolution mapping of chromatin states in individual cells. Recent studies using these techniques provide evidence that variations in different aspects of chromatin organization collectively define gene expression heterogeneity among otherwise highly similar cells.},

  abstract = {COPD is a heterogeneous syndrome. Many COPD subtypes have been proposed, but there is not yet consensus on how many COPD subtypes there are and how they should be defined. The COPD Genetic Epidemiology Study (COPDGene), which has generated 10-year longitudinal chest imaging, spirometry, and molecular data, is a rich resource for relating COPD phenotypes to underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms. In this article, we place COPDGene clustering studies in context with other highly cited COPD clustering studies, and summarize the main COPD subtype findings from COPDGene. First, most manifestations of COPD occur along a continuum, which explains why continuous aspects of COPD or disease axes may be more accurate and reproducible than subtypes identified through clustering methods. Second, continuous COPDrelated measures can be used to create subgroups through the use of predictive models to define cut-points, and we review COPDGene research on blood eosinophil count thresholds as a specific example. Third, COPD phenotypes identified or prioritized through machine learning methods have led to novel biological discoveries, including novel emphysema genetic risk variants and systemic inflammatory subtypes of COPD. Fourth, trajectory-based COPD subtyping captures differences in the longitudinal evolution of COPD, addressing a major limitation of clustering analyses that are confounded by disease severity. Ongoing longitudinal characterization of subjects in COPDGene will provide useful insights about the relationship between lung imaging parameters, molecular markers, and COPD progression that will enable the identification of subtypes based on underlying disease processes and distinct patterns of disease progression, with the potential to improve the clinical relevance and reproducibility of COPD subtypes.},

The exogenous administration of purified human serum-derived AAT is the only approved specific treatment for AATD in PiZZ. AAT augmentation therapy is not recommended in PiSZ, PiMZ or current smokers of any protein phenotype, or in patients with hepatic disease. Lung volume reduction and endoscopic bronchial valve placement are useful in selected patients, whereas the survival benefit of lung transplant is unclear.

On the basis of recent results from pathological studies and large clinical trials, the presence of airway inflammation does not seem to be sufficient to explain the complexity of the disease and the relatively poor response to treatment. It is probably time to abandon the concept of COPD as a unique disease and define, identify and treat the various aspects, which may differ between individuals. Among the different phenotypic distinctions, the classical distinction ‘‘chronic bronchitis’’ has mucus hypersecretion as the key presenting symptom. Its role in COPD has been the subject of an ongoing debate; however, it now appears to be being re-evaluated due to findings from recent epidemiological and pathological studies. In this context, the view that chronic mucus hypersecretion plays a secondary role in the pathogenesis of COPD should be abandoned and instead, drugs targeting mucus hypersecretion should be considered as a treatment option.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that COPD is currently the seventh leading cause of death and disability worldwide, but will rise to the fifth position by 2020. The estimated prevalence of COPD worldwide in 2001 was 1013/100,000 population; it was highest in the Western Pacific Region and lowest in Africa. The mortality from COPD followed the same pattern. The prevalence of smoking is slowly decreasing in the industrialised world and rising in developing countries, especially in Asia and Africa. Cigarette consumption per adult has also decreased in the Americas, remained the same in Europe but increased in all other regions, especially the Western Pacific. Indoor air pollution from combustion of biomass/traditional fuels and coal, previous tuberculous infection, outdoor air pollution and childhood respiratory infections are other important risk factors for COPD in developing countries. The rise in morbidity and mortality from COPD will be most dramatic in Asian and African countries over the next two decades, mostly due to progressive increase in the prevalence of smoking. As developing countries can ill afford the added economic burden of COPD and other smoking-related diseases, there is an urgent need for multi-dimensional actions in reducing the main risk factor of cigarette smoking.},

Studies have primarily assessed the relationship between smoking on COPD risk focusing on summary measures, like smoking status.                                         Objective               Develop a COPD risk prediction model incorporating individual time-varying smoking exposures.                                         Methods               The Nurses’ Health Study (N = 86,711) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (N = 39,817) data was used to develop a COPD risk prediction model. Data was randomly split in 50–50 samples for model building and validation. Cox regression with time-varying covariates was used to assess the association between smoking duration, intensity and year-since-quit and self-reported COPD diagnosis incidence. We evaluated the model calibration as well as discriminatory accuracy via the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC). We computed 6-year risk of COPD incidence given various individual smoking scenarios.                                         Results               Smoking duration, year-since-quit (if former smokers), sex, and interaction of sex and smoking duration are significantly associated with the incidence of diagnosed COPD. The model that incorporated time-varying smoking variables yielded higher AUCs compared to models using only pack-years. The AUCs for the model were 0.80 (95\% CI: 0.74–0.86) and 0.73 (95\% CI: 0.70–0.77) for males and females, respectively.                                         Conclusions               Utilizing detailed smoking pattern information, the model predicts COPD risk with better accuracy than models based on only smoking summary measures. It might serve as a tool for early detection programs by identifying individuals at high-risk for COPD.},

  abstract = {Introduction: COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease of lung. The inflammatory response in COPD is associated with neutrophils, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells, and occurs mainly in the small airway, leading to irreversible airflow limitation. Methods: In order to investigate the microRNA–mRNA interaction in the microenvironment of the COPD airway, we used next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics in this study. Results: We identified four genes with microRNA–mRNA interactions involved in COPD small-airway bronchial epithelial cells: NT5E, SDK1, TNS1, and PCDH7. Furthermore, miR6511a-5p–NT5E interaction was found to be involved in small-airway bronchial epithelial cells, large-airway bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages. Conclusion: Our results showed that miR6511a-5p–NT5E interaction plays an important role in COPD, which might be associated with cell–cell contact, activation of leukocytes, activation of T lymphocytes, and cellular homeostasis. These findings provide new information for further investigations of the COPD microenvironment, and may help to develop new diagnostic or therapeutic strategies targeting the bronchial epithelium for COPD.

  abstract = {NAD(H) and NADP(H) have traditionally been viewed as co-factors (or co-enzymes) involved in a myriad of oxidation-reduction reactions including the electron transport in the mitochondria. However, NAD pathway metabolites have many other important functions, including roles in signaling pathways, post-translational modifications, epigenetic changes, and regulation of RNA stability and function via NAD-capping of RNA. Non-oxidative reactions ultimately lead to the net catabolism of these nucleotides, indicating that NAD metabolism is an extremely dynamic process. In fact, recent studies have clearly demonstrated that NAD has a halflife in the order of minutes in some tissues. Several evolving concepts on the metabolism, transport, and roles of these NAD pathway metabolites in disease states such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging have emerged in just the last few years. In this perspective, we discuss key recent discoveries and changing concepts in NAD metabolism and biology that are reshaping the field. In addition, we will pose some open questions in NAD biology, including why NAD metabolism is so fast and dynamic in some tissues, how NAD and its precursors are transported to cells and organelles, and how NAD metabolism is integrated with inflammation and senescence. Resolving these questions will lead to significant advancements in the field.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined by the presence of airflow limitation on spirometry, yet subjects with COPD can have marked differences in computed tomography imaging. These differences may be driven by genetic factors. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of quantitative imaging would identify loci not previously identified in analyses of COPD or spirometry. In addition, we sought to determine whether previously described genome-wide significant COPD and spirometric loci were associated with emphysema or airway phenotypes. Objectives: To identify genetic determinants of quantitative imaging phenotypes. Methods: We performed a GWAS on two quantitative emphysema and two quantitative airway imaging phenotypes in the COPDGene (non-Hispanic white and African American), ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints), NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial), and GenKOLS (Genetics of COPD, Norway) studies and on percentage gas trapping in COPDGene. We also examined specific loci reported as genomewide significant for spirometric phenotypes related to airflow limitation or COPD. Measurements and Main Results: The total sample size across all cohorts was 12,031, of whom 9,338 were from COPDGene. We identified five loci associated with emphysema-related phenotypes, one with airway-related phenotypes, and two with gas trapping. These loci included previously reported associations, including the HHIP, 15q25, and AGER loci, as well as novel associations near SERPINA10 and DLC1. All previously reported COPD and a significant number of spirometric GWAS loci were at least nominally (P , 0.05) associated with either emphysema or airway phenotypes. Conclusions: Genome-wide analysis may identify novel risk factors for quantitative imaging characteristics in COPD and also identify imaging features associated with previously identified lung function loci.},

  abstract = {We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating \textasciitilde 356,660 candidate SNPs in \textasciitilde 117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of \textasciitilde 1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w1118; iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y1; cn1 bw1 sp1 strain. We show that \textasciitilde 15,842 SNPs are synonymous and \textasciitilde 4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S \textasciitilde 0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3'UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

The hippocampus expresses high levels of glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and its development is affected by elevated fetal glucocorticoid levels. Antenatal sGC results in neuroendocrine and behavioral changes that persist in three generations of female guinea pig offspring of the paternal lineage. We hypothesized that antenatal sGC results in transgenerational changes in gene expression that correlate with changes in DNA methylation. We used RNASeq and capture probe bisulfite sequencing to investigate the transcriptomic and epigenomic effects of antenatal sGC exposure in the hippocampus of three generations of juvenile female offspring from the paternal lineage. Antenatal sGC exposure (F               0               pregnancy) resulted in generation-specific changes in hippocampal gene transcription and DNA methylation. Significant changes in individual CpG methylation occurred in RNApol II binding regions of small non-coding RNA (snRNA) genes, which implicates alternative splicing as a mechanism involved in transgenerational transmission of the effects of antenatal sGC. This study provides novel perspectives on the mechanisms involved in transgenerational transmission and highlights the importance of human studies to determine the longer-term effects of antenatal sGC on hippocampal-related function.},

  abstract = {Summary Background: According to the GOLD international guidelines, the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be proportional to the severity of airflow obstruction graded according to FEV1\% predicted. Regular treatment with long-acting bronchodilators should be prescribed for symptomatic patients with FEV1 {$<$} 80\%. Inhaled corticosteroids should be added in patients with FEV1 {$<$} 50\% predicted and frequent exacerbations. Aim: To investigate whether pulmonologists follow the GOLD guidelines when prescribing treatment for COPD. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study was carried out in 49 Pulmonary Units evenly distributed throughout the country. For each patient the demographic, clinical data and the current therapies were registered in an electronic database. Results: 4094 patients (mean age: 70.9   9.4; males 72.4\%, female 27.6\%) were enrolled. Disease severity was classified as: mild (745), moderate (1722), severe (923), very severe (704). Irrespective of disease severity, inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with long-acting bronchodilators were used in 15.2\% and 66.8\% of patients, respectively. The appropriateness of the pharmacological treatment of the COPD patients was defined in accordance with the GOLD recommendations. The treatment was appropriate in 37.9\% of patients and inappropriate in 62.1\%, p {$<$} 0.0001. The inappropriateness was due to under-prescription in 7.2\% and to over-prescription in 54.9\% of patients. The presence and the number of exacerbations represented an important trigger for over-prescription at stages I and II. Conclusions: This study shows that there is a poor relationship between the recommendations of the GOLD international guidelines and current clinical practice, and that exacerbations may play a role in over-prescription.},

This process is disrupted in several types of inherited retinal dystrophy, but the driving force remained unclear. We show that C2orf71/PCARE (photoreceptor cilium actin regulator), associated with inherited retinal dystrophy subtype RP54, efficiently recruits the Arp2/3 complex activator WASF3 to the cilium. This activates an actin dynamics-driven expansion of the ciliary tip, resembling membrane evagination in lamellipodia formation. Colocalization of this actin dynamics module to the base of the outer segments, and absence thereof in               Pcare                                −/−                              mice, suggests PCARE-regulated actin dynamics as a critical process in outer segment disk formation.                        ,                             The outer segments (OS) of rod and cone photoreceptor cells are specialized sensory cilia that contain hundreds of opsin-loaded stacked membrane disks that enable phototransduction. The biogenesis of these disks is initiated at the OS base, but the driving force has been debated. Here, we studied the function of the protein encoded by the photoreceptor-specific gene               C2orf71               , which is mutated in inherited retinal dystrophy (RP54). We demonstrate that C2orf71/PCARE (photoreceptor cilium actin regulator) can interact with the Arp2/3 complex activator WASF3, and efficiently recruits it to the primary cilium. Ectopic coexpression of PCARE and WASF3 in ciliated cells results in the remarkable expansion of the ciliary tip. This process was disrupted by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based down-regulation of an actin regulator, by pharmacological inhibition of actin polymerization, and by the expression of PCARE harboring a retinal dystrophy-associated missense mutation. Using human retinal organoids and mouse retina, we observed that a similar actin dynamics-driven process is operational at the base of the photoreceptor OS where the PCARE module and actin colocalize, but which is abrogated in               Pcare                                −/−                              mice. The observation that several proteins involved in retinal ciliopathies are translocated to these expansions renders it a potential common denominator in the pathomechanisms of these hereditary disorders. Together, our work suggests that PCARE is an actin-associated protein that interacts with WASF3 to regulate the actin-driven expansion of the ciliary membrane at the initiation of new outer segment disk formation.},

NAD+ is also an essential cofactor for non-redox NAD+-dependent enzymes, including sirtuins, CD38 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. NAD+ can directly and indirectly influence many key cellular functions, including metabolic pathways, DNA repair, chromatin remodelling, cellular senescence and immune cell function. These cellular processes and functions are critical for maintaining tissue and metabolic homeostasis and for healthy ageing. Remarkably, ageing is accompanied by a gradual decline in tissue and cellular NAD+ levels in multiple model organisms, including rodents and humans. This decline in NAD+ levels is linked causally to numerous ageing-associated diseases, including cognitive decline, cancer, metabolic disease, sarcopenia and frailty. Many of these ageing-associated diseases can be slowed down and even reversed by restoring NAD+ levels. Therefore, targeting NAD+ metabolism has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach to ameliorate ageing-related disease, and extend the human healthspan and lifespan. However, much remains to be learnt about how NAD+ influences human health and ageing biology. This includes a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate NAD+ levels, how to effectively restore NAD+ levels during ageing, whether doing so is safe and whether NAD+ repletion will have beneficial effects in ageing humans.},

It was the largest and most complete collection of patient demographic, clinical, physiological, and radiographic data ever compiled in severe emphysema. NETT investigated the effects of optimal medical management and LVRS on short- and long-term survival, as well as lung function, exercise performance, and quality of life. NETT also provided much information regarding the evaluation and prognosis of severe emphysema; specifically the important negative influences that hyperinflation and small airway disease have on survival. NETT emphasized the importance of addressing nonpulmonary issues such as nutrition, cardiac disease, anxiety, and depression in emphysema. NETT demonstrated that physiological, genomic, and radiographic phenotype can predict patient survival as well as response to treatment. Because the major purpose of NETT was to compare bilateral LVRS with optimal medical treatment in emphysema, patients enrolled into NETT were comprehensively characterized and selected to have a specific window of airflow obstruction and hyperinflation and to lack significant comorbidities. The NETT patient population’s restrictive features offer distinct advantages (well-characterized predominant emphysematous phenotype) and disadvantages (lack of comorbidities and significant chronic bronchitis) that must be considered when interpreting the implications of these results. Herein, we provide a summary of the major NETT findings that provide insight into the evaluation and medical treatment of emphysema.},

In this study, we used an AT1 cell-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb VIII B2) to investigate expression of the AT1 cell phenotype accompanying reversible changes in expression of the AT2 cell phenotype. AT2 cells were isolated and cultured either on attached collagen gels or on gels detached 1 or 4 days after plating and maintained thereafter as floating gels. Monolayers on both attached and floating gels were harvested on days 4 and 8 and analyzed by electron microscopy for changes in morphology and binding of mAb VIII B2. Results indicate that: (1) alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) on attached gels develop characteristics of the AT1 cell phenotype, (2) AEC on gels detached on day 1 maintain features of the AT2 cell phenotype (and do not react with mAb VIII B2), and (3) the expression of AT1 cell phenotypic traits seen by day 4 on attached gels is reversed after detachment. We conclude that commitment to the AT1 and AT2 cell lineages requires continuous regulatory input to maintain the differentiated states, and that transdifferentiation between AT2 and AT1 cells may be reversible.},

  abstract = {Abstract | Fine-tuning cellular physiology in response to intracellular and environmental cues requires precise temporal and spatial control of gene expression. High-resolution imaging technologies to detect mRNAs and their translation state have revealed that all living organisms localize mRNAs in subcellular compartments and create translation hotspots, enabling cells to tune gene expression locally. Therefore, mRNA localization is a conserved and integral part of gene expression regulation from prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of mRNA transport and local mRNA translation across the kingdoms of life and at organellar, subcellular and multicellular resolution. We also discuss the properties of messenger ribonucleoprotein and higher order RNA granules and how they may influence mRNA transport and local protein synthesis. Finally, we summarize the technological developments that allow us to study mRNA localization and local translation through the simultaneous detection of mRNAs and proteins in single cells, mRNA and nascent protein single-molecule imaging, and bulk RNA and protein detection methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract | Genomic DNA is folded into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs), which serve important structural and regulatory roles. It has been proposed that these genomic structures are formed by a loop extrusion process, which is mediated by structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes. Recent single-molecule studies have shown that the SMC complexes condensin and cohesin are indeed able to extrude DNA into loops. In this Review, we discuss how the loop extrusion hypothesis can explain key features of genome architecture; cellular functions of loop extrusion, such as separation of replicated DNA molecules, facilitation of enhancer–promoter interactions and immunoglobulin gene recombination; and what is known about the mechanism of loop extrusion and its regulation, for example, by chromatin boundaries that depend on the DNA binding protein CTCF. We also discuss how the loop extrusion hypothesis has led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of both genome architecture and the functions of SMC complexes.},

To improve this, we use RNA-seq data from 31,499 samples to predict which genes cause specific disease phenotypes, and develop GeneNetwork Assisted Diagnostic Optimization (GADO). We show that this unbiased method, which does not rely upon specific knowledge on individual genes, is effective in both identifying previously unknown disease gene associations, and flagging genes that have previously been incorrectly implicated in disease. GADO can be run on www.genenetwork.nl by supplying HPO-terms and a list of genes that contain candidate variants. Finally, applying GADO to a cohort of 61 patients for whom exome-sequencing analysis had not resulted in a genetic diagnosis, yields likely causative genes for ten cases.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by chronic inflammation of the airways and progressive destruction of lung parenchyma, a process that in most cases is initiated by cigarette smoking. Several mechanisms are involved in the development of the disease: influx of inflammatory cells into the lung (leading to chronic inflammation of the airways), imbalance between proteolytic and anti-proteolytic activity (resulting in the destruction of healthy lung tissue) and oxidative stress. Recently, an increasing number of data suggest a fourth important mechanism involved in the development of COPD: apoptosis of structural cells in the lung might possibly be an important upstream event in the pathogenesis of COPD. There is an increase in apoptotic alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells in the lungs of COPD patients. Since this is not counterbalanced by an increase in proliferation of these structural cells, the net result is destruction of lung tissue and the development of emphysema. Data from animal models suggest a role for Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in the induction of apoptosis of structural cells in the lung. Other mediators of apoptosis, such as caspase-3 and ceramide, could be interesting targets to prevent apoptosis and the development of emphysema.             In this review, recent data on the role of apoptosis in COPD from both animal models as well as from studies on human subjects will be discussed. The aim is to provide an up to date summary on the increasing knowledge on the role of apoptosis in COPD and pulmonary emphysema.},

  abstract = {Breathing is essential for survival and is precisely regulated by the nervous system. From a neuroanatomical perspective, the respiratory tract is innervated by afferent and efferent autonomic nerves, which regulate aspects of airway function and ensure appropriate tissue oxygenation. The general concepts of how the peripheral nervous system (PNS) develops as it relates to lung function are reviewed. The vagus (cranial nerve X), a mixed motor and sensory nerve, supplies parasympathetic and sensory fibers to the airways. During development, preganglionic visceromotor efferent neurons of the cranial nerves arise in the hindbrain basal plate and later migrate dorsally through the neuroepithelium.             The neural crest is a migratory and multipotent embryonic cell population that develops at the dorsal portion of the neural tube, which delaminates from the neuroepithelium to enter distinct pathways, forming various derivatives, among which include the peripheral nervous system. Neural crest cells emerging from the vagal region migrate into the ventral foregut and give rise to intrinsic ganglia in the respiratory tract that are innervated from the vagus and send out postganglionic fibers.             The lung is innervated by sympathetic nerves derived from the upper thoracic and cervical ganglia. The sympathetic preganglionic neurons are derived from trunk neural crest cells that migrate, forming two chains of sympathetic ganglia referred to as the lateral vertebral sympathetic chains. Neural crest cells that migrate along defined pathways to generate sympathetic ganglia also derivate the dorsal root ganglia that send somatosensory afferent innervations to the respiratory tract.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Little is known about the clinical factors associated with the development of lung cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although airway obstruction and emphysema have been identified as possible risk factors. Objectives: To explore incidence, histologic type, and factors associated with development of lung cancer diagnosis in a cohort of outpatients with COPD attending a pulmonary clinic. Methods: A cohort of 2,507 patients without initial clinical or radiologic evidence of lung cancer was followed a median of 60 months (30–90). At baseline, anthropometrics, smoking history, lung function, and body composition were recorded. Time to diagnosis and histologic type of lung cancer was then registered. Cox analysis was used to explore factors associated with lung cancer diagnosis. MeasurementsandMainResults: A total of 215 of the 2,507 patients with COPD developed lung cancer (incidence density of 16.7 cases per 1,000 person-years). The most frequent type was squamous cell carcinoma (44\%). Lung cancer incidence was lower in patients with worse severity of airflow obstruction. Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stages I and II, older age, lower body mass index, and lung diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide less than 80\% were associated with lung cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: Incidence density of lung cancer is high in outpatients with COPD and occurs more frequently in older patients with milder airflow obstruction (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stages I and II) and lower body mass index. A lung diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide less than 80\% is associated with cancer diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent histologic type. Knowledge of these factors may help direct efforts for early detection of lung cancer and disease management.},

Methods                                We performed transcriptional profiling of sputum to explore the molecular biology and compared the predictive value of an unbiased gene signature                 versus                 sputum eosinophils for exacerbations after ICS withdrawal in COPD patients. RNA-sequencing data of induced sputum samples from 43 COPD patients were associated with the time to exacerbation after ICS withdrawal. Expression profiles of differentially expressed genes were summarised to create gene signatures. In addition, we built a Bayesian network model to determine coregulatory networks related to the onset of COPD exacerbations after ICS withdrawal.

The addition of this gene signature to a multiple Cox regression model explained more variance of time to exacerbations compared to a model using sputum eosinophils. The gene signature correlated with sputum eosinophil as well as macrophage cell counts. The Bayesian network model identified three coregulatory gene networks as well as sex to be related to an early                 versus                 late/nonexacerbation phenotype.                                                        Conclusion               We identified a sputum gene expression signature that exhibited a higher predictive value for predicting COPD exacerbations after ICS withdrawal than sputum eosinophilia. Future studies should investigate the utility of this signature, which might enhance personalised ICS treatment in COPD patients.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. Results: To align our large (480 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of 450 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2   76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone Cþþ code.

  abstract = {Protein networks have become a popular tool for analyzing and visualizing the often long lists of proteins or genes obtained from proteomics and other high-throughput technologies. One of the most popular sources of such networks is the STRING database, which provides protein networks for more than 2000 organisms, including both physical interactions from experimental data and functional associations from curated pathways, automatic text mining, and prediction methods. However, its web interface is mainly intended for inspection of small networks and their underlying evidence. The Cytoscape software, on the other hand, is much better suited for working with large networks and offers greater flexibility in terms of network analysis, import, and visualization of additional data. To include both resources in the same workflow, we created stringApp, a Cytoscape app that makes it easy to import STRING networks into Cytoscape, retains the appearance and many of the features of STRING, and integrates data from associated databases. Here, we introduce many of the stringApp features and show how they can be used to carry out complex network analysis and visualization tasks on a typical proteomics data set, all through the Cytoscape user interface. stringApp is freely available from the Cytoscape app store: http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/stringapp.},

The structural changes found on pathological examination of remodelled airway wall have been shown to display similarities but also differences. Computed tomography (CT) is today a remarkable tool to assess airway wall morphology               in vivo               since submillimetric acquisitions over the whole lung volume could be obtained allowing 3D evaluation. Recently, CT-derived indices extracted from CT images have been described and are thought to assess airway remodelling. This may help understand the complex mechanism underlying the remodelling process, which is still not fully understood. This paper summarizes the various methods described to quantify airway remodelling in asthma and COPD using CT, and similarities and differences between both diseases will be emphasized.},

  abstract = {Parasympathetic neurons in the airways control bronchomotor tone. Increased activity of cholinergic neurons are mediators of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthma, however, mechanisms are not elucidated. We describe remodeling of the cholinergic neuronal network in asthmatic airways driven by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB). Human bronchial biopsies were stained for cholinergic marker vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Human lung gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in neuroplasticity-related genes were compared between asthma and healthy patients. Wild-type (WT) and mutated TrkB knock-in mice (Ntrk2tm1Ddg/J) with impaired BDNF signaling were chronically exposed to ovalbumin (OVA). Neuronal VAChT staining and airway narrowing in response to electrical field stimulation in precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were assessed. Increased cholinergic fibers in asthmatic airway biopsies was found, paralleled by increased TrkB gene expression in human lung tissue, and SNPs in the NTRK2 [TrkB] and BDNF genes linked to asthma. Chronic allergen exposure in mice resulted in increased density of cholinergic nerves, which was prevented by inhibiting TrkB. Increased nerve density resulted in AHR in vivo and in increased nerve-dependent airway reactivity in lung slices mediated via TrkB. These findings show cholinergic neuroplasticity in asthma driven by TrkB signaling and suggest that the BDNF-TrkB pathway may be a potential target.},

While studies have shown that smoking alters bronchial epithelial function and morphology, its precise effects on specific cell types and overall tissue composition are unclear. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to profile bronchial epithelial cells from six never and six current smokers. Unsupervised analyses led to the characterization of a set of toxin metabolism genes that localized to smoker ciliated cells, tissue remodeling associated with a loss of club cells and extensive goblet cell hyperplasia, and a previously unidentified peri-goblet epithelial subpopulation in smokers who expressed a marker of bronchial premalignant lesions. Our data demonstrate that smoke exposure drives a complex landscape of cellular alterations that may prime the human bronchial epithelium for disease.},

The prototypical roles of the matrix proteins, collagen and elastin, in pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema have long been recognized, and much research effort has been devoted to understanding mechanisms of extracellular matrix synthesis and turnover in the lung. Yet, despite extensive knowledge of the biochemical properties of collagen and elastin, none of the present clinical strategies for treating COPD directly target the extracellular matrix. From a matrix perspective, therapeutic interventions that limit elastic fiber destruction and/or restore function to damaged alveolar units merit particular consideration as clinical strategies for treating the emphysema component of COPD. Effective treatment of the bronchiolar component of COPD requires a better understanding of the relationship between airway fibrosis and airflow obstruction. Translating basic knowledge of extracellular matrix biology into the clinical venue will be essential in the development of new approaches to COPD treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic condition predisposing individuals to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The treatment is generally extrapolated from COPD unrelated to AATD; however, most COPD trials exclude AATD patients; thus, this study sought to systematically review AATD-specific literature to assist evidence-based patient management. Methods: Standard review methodology was used with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis (PROSPERO-CRD42015019354). Eligible studies were those of any treatment used in severe AATD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were the primary focus; however, case series and uncontrolled studies were eligible. All studies had \$10 participants receiving treatment or usual care, with baseline and follow-up data (.3 months). Risk of bias was assessed appropriately according to study methodology. Results: In all, 7,296 studies were retrieved from searches; 52 trials with 5,632 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which 26 studies involved alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation and 17 concerned surgical treatments (largely transplantation). Studies were grouped into four management themes: COPD medical, COPD surgical, AATD specific, and other treatments. Computed tomography (CT) density, forced expiratory volume in 1 s, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide, health status, and exacerbation rates were frequently used as outcomes. Meta-analyses were only possible for RCTs of intravenous augmentation, which slowed progression of emphysema measured by CT density change, 0.79 g/L/year versus placebo (P=0.002), and associated with a small increase in exacerbations 0.29/year (P=0.02). Mortality following lung transplant was comparable between AATD- and non-AATD-related COPD. Surgical reduction of lung volume demonstrated inferior outcomes compared with non-AATD-related emphysema. Conclusion: Intravenous augmentation remains the only disease-specific therapy in AATD and there is evidence that this slows decline in emphysema determined by CT density. There is paucity of data around other treatments in AATD. Treatments for usual COPD may not be as efficacious in AATD, and further studies may be required for this disease group},

  abstract = {Rationale: Although cigarette smoking is the most important cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a substantial proportion of COPD cases cannot be explained by smoking alone. Objectives: To evaluate the risk factors for COPD besides personal cigarette smoking. Methods: We constituted an ad hoc subcommittee of the American Thoracic Society Environmental and Occupational Health Assembly. An international group of members was invited, based on their scientific expertise in a specific risk factor for COPD. For each risk factor area, the committee reviewed the literature, summarized the evidence, and developed conclusions about the likelihood of it causing COPD. All conclusions were based on unanimous consensus. Measurements and Main Results: The population-attributable fraction for smoking as a cause of COPD ranged from 9.7 to 97.9\%, but was less than 80\% in most studies, indicating a substantial burden of disease attributable to nonsmoking risk factors. On the basis of our review, we concluded that specific genetic syndromes and occupational exposures were causally related to the development of COPD. Traffic and other outdoor pollution, secondhand smoke, biomass smoke, and dietary factors are associated with COPD, but sufficient criteria for causation were not met. Chronic asthma and tuberculosis are associated with irreversible loss of lung function, but there remains uncertainty about whether there are important phenotypic differences compared with COPD as it is typically encountered in clinical settings. Conclusions: In public health terms, a substantive burden of COPD is attributable to risk factors other than smoking. To prevent COPDrelated disability and mortality, efforts must focus on prevention and cessation of exposure to smoking and these other, less wellrecognized risk factors.},

  abstract = {Woese and Fox’s 1977 paper on the discovery of the Archaea triggered a revolution in the field of evolutionary biology by showing that life was divided into not only prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Rather, they revealed that prokaryotes comprise two distinct types of organisms, the Bacteria and the Archaea. In subsequent years, molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that eukaryotes and the Archaea represent sister groups in the tree of life. During the genomic era, it~became evident that eukaryotic cells possess a mixture of archaeal and bacterial features in addition to eukaryotic-specific features. Although it has been generally accepted for some time that mitochondria descend from endosymbiotic alphaproteobacteria, the precise evolutionary relationship between eukaryotes and archaea has continued to be a subject of debate. In this Review, we outline a brief history of the changing shape of the tree of life and examine how the recent discovery of a myriad of diverse archaeal lineages has changed our understanding of the~evolutionary relationships between the three domains of life and the origin of eukaryotes. Furthermore, we revisit central questions regarding the process of eukaryogenesis and discuss what can currently be inferred about the evolutionary transition from the first to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT DNA methylation patterns in chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) might offer new insights into disease pathogenesis. To assess methylation profiles in the main COPD target organ, we performed an epigenome-wide association study on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells. Bronchoscopies were performed in 18 COPD subjects and 15 controls (ex- and current smokers). DNA methylation was measured with Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip covering {$>$}850,000 CpGs. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were examined for 1) enrichment in pathways and functional gene relationships using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology; 2) accelerated aging using Horvath’s epigenetic clock; 3) correlation with gene expression; and 4) colocalization with genetic variation. We found 1,155 Bonferroni significant (P {$<$} 6.74 × 10-8) DMPs associated with COPD, many with large effect sizes. Functional analysis identified biologically plausible pathways and gene relationships, including enrichment for transcription factor activity. Strong correlation was found between DNA methylation and chronological age, but not between COPD and accelerated aging. For 79 unique DMPs, DNA methylation correlated significantly with gene expression in BAL cells. Thirty-nine percent of DMPs were co-localized with COPD-associated SNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first EWAS of COPD on BAL cells, and our analyses revealed many differential methylation sites. Integration with mRNA data showed a strong functional readout for relevant genes, identifying sites where DNA methylation might directly impact expression. Almost half of DMPs were co-located with SNPs identified in previous GWAS of COPD, suggesting joint genetic and epigenetic pathways related to disease.},

  abstract = {The aim was to investigate whether microRNA (miRNA) expression is modulated by inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment             We performed genome-wide miRNA analysis on bronchial biopsies of 69 moderate/severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients at baseline and after 6- and 30-month treatment with the ICS fluticasone propionate or placebo. The effect of ICS on miRNA expression was validated in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cultures, and functional studies were conducted in BEAS-2B cells. MiRNAs affected by ICS and their predicted targets were compared to an independent miRNA dataset of bronchial brushings from COPD patients and healthy controls.                            Treatment with ICS for both 6 and 30 months significantly altered the expression of four miRNAs, including miR-320d, which was increased during ICS treatment compared with placebo. The ICS-induced increase of miR-320d was confirmed in primary airway epithelial cells. MiR-320d negatively correlated targets were enriched for pro-inflammatory genes and were increased in the bronchial brushes of patients with lower lung function in the independent dataset. Overexpression of miR-320d in BEAS-2B cells dampened cigarette smoke extract-induced pro-inflammatory activity               via               inhibition of nuclear factor-κB.                          Collectively, we identified miR-320d as a novel mediator of ICS, regulating the pro-inflammatory response of the airway epithelium.},

  abstract = {Background: COPD is characterized by chronic inflammation of the lungs to noxious particles such as cigarette smoke leading to accelerated decline in lung function. The inflammation associated with smoke exposure remains even after smoking stops. Aim \&amp; Objectives: This study aims to investigate the longitudinal effects of smoking cessation at transcriptomic and epigenetic levels. Methods: Bronchial biopsies were collected from 19 individuals (healthy= 7, COPD= 12) before and after 12 months smoking cessation followed by DNA/RNA extraction. DNA methylation was measured using Infinium-HumanMethylation850k and RNA-Seq using Illumina-NovaSeq6000 sequencing. A Benjamini–Hochberg corrected p{$<$}0.05 and the fold change{$>$}|1.5| was considered significant. We used expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) analysis to correlate gene expression with DNA methylation. Results: Differential gene expression analysis before and after 12 months smoking cessation resulted in 613 differentially expressed genes, including a number of down-regulated oxidative stress genes (i.e. ALDH3A1, which oxidises toxic aldehydes and protects the airway epithelium from smoking-induced oxidative stress). Differential DNA methylation analysis before and after smoking cessation identified 261 hypomethylated, 289 hypermethylated significant CpG-sites, e.g. cg19171383. The CpG site cg19171383 was found to be differentially methylated and was negatively correlated with ALDH3A1 in the eQTM analysis. An interaction analysis of smoking cessation with disease found not differences at a transcriptomic and epigenetic levels. Conclusion: These findings indicate that smoking cessation increases the methylation of oxidative stress related genes, which may lead to their decrease in expression.},

  abstract = {Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) contributes to the morbidity and mortality of asthma, and remains uncontrolled by current therapies in the subset of patients with severe, steroidresistant disease. Altered cross-talk between airway epithelium and airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, provides a potential mechanism that influences CMH. This study investigated mechanisms underlying CMH by comparing IL-1β-induced gene expression profiles between asthma and control-derived ASMCs and the subsequent paracrine influence on airway epithelial mucus production in vitro. IL-1β-treated ASMCs from asthmatic patients and healthy donors were profiled using microarray analysis and ELISA. Air–liquid interface (ALI)-cultured CALU-3 and primary airway epithelial cells were treated with identified candidates and mucus production assessed. The IL-1β-induced CCL20 expression and protein release was increased in ASMCs from moderate compared with mild asthmatic patients and healthy controls. IL-1β induced lower MIR146A expression in asthma-derived ASMCs compared with controls. Decreased MIR146A expression was validated in vivo in bronchial biopsies from 16 asthmatic patients versus 39 healthy donors. miR-146a-5p overexpression abrogated CCL20 release in ASMCs. CCL20 treatment of ALI-cultured CALU-3 and primary airway epithelial cells induced mucus production, while CCL20 levels in sputum were associated with increased levels of CMH in asthmatic patients. Elevated CCL20 production by ASMCs, possibly resulting from dysregulated expression of the antiinflammatory miR-146a-5p, may contribute to enhanced mucus production in asthma.},

Methods Prospective 3-month cohort study of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD who were provided a portable electronic inhaler sensor to monitor daily SABA use. Subjects wore a pedometer for 3 seven-day periods and were asked to complete a daily diary of symptoms and inhaler use. Overuse was defined as {$>$}8 actuations of their SABA per day while clinically stable. Results Among 32 participants, 15 overused their SABA inhaler at least once (mean 8.6~±~5.0 puffs/day), and 6 overused their inhaler more than 50\% of monitored days. Compared to those with no overuse, overusers had greater dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale: 2.7 vs. 1.9, p~=~0.02), were more likely to use home oxygen (67\% vs. 29\%, p~=~0.04), and were more likely to be on maximal inhaled therapy (long-acting beta-agonist, long-acting antimuscarinic agent, and an inhaled steroid: 40\% vs. 6\%, p~=~0.03), and most had completed pulmonary rehabilitation (67\% vs. 0\%, p~{$<~$}0.001). However, 27\% of overusers of SABA were not on guideline-concordant COPD therapy. Conclusions Overuse of SABA was common and associated with increased disease severity and symptoms, even though overusers were on more COPD-related inhalers and more had completed pulmonary rehabilitation. More research is needed to understand factors associated with inhaler overuse and how to improve correct inhaler use.},

Recently, it has been replaced by Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC) covering over 850,000 CpGs distributed genome-wide. Many consortia have now datasets coming from both arrays and aspire to analyze the two together. The placenta shows a high number of intermediate methylation levels and is often investigated for obstetric/birth outcomes, and potentially for long-term programming in offspring. We performed a systematic comparison between the two arrays using 108 duplicate placental samples from Gen3G birth cohort. We find that placenta shows a high per-sample correlation between the arrays, and higher median correlations at individual CpGs than those reported for blood. We identify 26,340 probes with absolute difference in per cent methylation {$>$}10\%. We conclude that EPIC and 450K placental data can be combined, and we provide two lists of CpGs that should be excluded to avoid misleading results.},

The aim of this study was to assess the extent of extracellular matrix remodeling in emphysema by ultrastructural examination of elastin and collagen templates in an animal model of emphysema and in human emphysematous lungs. Emphysema was induced in rats by the intratracheal administration of porcine pancreatic elastase. Human lung samples were obtained at surgical resection for lung carcinoma. Emphysema was confirmed morphometrically and quantitated using the mean linear intercept. Matching sections were treated with sodium hydroxide and formic acid to expose collagen and elastin templates, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy with stereo-pair imaging allowed three-dimensional visualization of the exposed templates. In emphysematous lungs from both sources, sheets of elastin were disrupted and perforated with multiple fenestrations. In elastase-induced emphysema, this disintegration was accompanied by a marked increase in thickness of collagen fibrils, which contrasted with the fine fibrillar network of control lungs. Similarly, a pattern of thickened fibrils and disorganized deposition of collagen was observed in human lungs. In conclusion, these findings support the novel concept of increased collagen deposition and aberrant collagen remodeling in the pathogenesis of emphysema.},

  abstract = {Emerging technologies for analyzing biospecimens have led to advances in understanding the interacting role of genetics and environment on development and individual responsivity to prevention and intervention programs. The scientific study of geneenvironment influences has also benefited from the growth of Big Data tools that allow linking genomic data to health, educational, and other information stored in large integrated datasets. These advances have created a new frontier of ethical challenges for scientists as they collect, store, or engage in secondary use of potentially identifiable information and biospecimens. To address challenges arising from technological advances and the expanding contexts in which potentially identifiable information and biospecimens are collected and stored, the Office of Human Research Protections has revised federal regulations for the protection of human subjects. The revised regulations create a new format, content, and transparency requirements for informed consent, including a new mechanism known as broad consent. Broad consent offers participants a range of choices regarding consent for the storage and future use of their personally identifiable data. These regulations have important implications for how prevention scientists and oversight boards acquire participant consent for the collection, storage, and future use of their data by other investigators for scientific purposes significantly different from the original study. This article describes regulatory changes and challenges affecting traditional informed consent for prevention research, followed by a description of the rationale and requirements for obtaining broad consent, and concludes with a discussion of future challenges involving ongoing transparency and protections for participants and their communities.},

The RNA was processed into fastq files for each library prior to being analyzed using Illumina Digital Gene Expression Tag Profiling sequences (DGETP) which were used as the downstream measure of differential expression. Analyzed tags consisted of 21 base pair sequences taken from time points 1, 3, 6, and 14 days' post infection (dpi) that generated 1,927,547 unique tag sequences. Tag sequences were analyzed for differential transcript expression and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to uncover transcriptomic changes related to PRV pathology progression. In conjunction with the DGETP and GSEA, the study also incorporated use of leading edge analysis to help link the TBLN transcriptome data to clinical progression of PRV at each of the sampled time points. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide useful background on applying the leading edge analysis to GSEA and expression data to help identify genes considered to be of high biological interest.

Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The STRING database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {$>$}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of STRING, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},

  abstract = {microRNAs (miRNAs) are a large class of small noncoding RNAs which post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of a large fraction of all animal genes and are important in a wide range of biological processes. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing allow miRNA detection at unprecedented sensitivity, but the computational task of accurately identifying the miRNAs in the background of sequenced RNAs remains challenging. For this purpose, we have designed miRDeep2, a substantially improved algorithm which identifies canonical and non-canonical miRNAs such as those derived from transposable elements and informs on highconfidence candidates that are detected in multiple independent samples. Analyzing data from seven animal species representing the major animal clades, miRDeep2 identified miRNAs with an accuracy of 98.6–99.9\% and reported hundreds of novel miRNAs. To test the accuracy of miRDeep2, we knocked down the miRNA biogenesis pathway in a human cell line and sequenced small RNAs before and after. The vast majority of the {$>$}100 novel miRNAs expressed in this cell line were indeed specifically downregulated, validating most miRDeep2 predictions. Last, a new miRNA expression profiling routine, low time and memory usage and userfriendly interactive graphic output can make miRDeep2 useful to a wide range of researchers.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2–7), particularly those in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here, we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3′UTRs, increasing by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new genomes and more completely controls for background conservation by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates, and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the “offset 6mer,” to be detected. In total, {$>$}45,000 miRNA target sites within human 3′UTRs are conserved above background levels, and {$>$}60\% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing to the 3′ end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this class of sites constitutes less than 2\% of all preferentially conserved sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially conserved targeting (               P               CT               ) correlating with experimental measurements of repression.

COPD is under- diagnosed and often misdiagnosed, which likely contributes to the continuing increases in the prevalence, morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. This is unfortunate because whereas COPD cannot be cured, it can be treated effectively, particularly during the earlier stages of the disease. Evidence-based guidelines, developed to assist in the prevention, diagnosis and management of COPD, are available to healthcare professionals interested in learning more about COPD. These guidelines are updated and revised on a regular basis to reflect recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of and treatments available for COPD. Nevertheless, primary-care physicians have reported a lack of awareness of the fundamental concepts underpinning the optimal treatment and management of COPD presented in the guidelines. Thus, the objective of this arti- cle is to summarise key physiologic, diagnostic and management concepts provided in the most recent update of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Dis- ease (GOLD) guidelines, which were published in November 2006.},

For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to find the characteristics of each group. However, existing DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that most differentiate groups. This paper presents an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, the interactive visualization interface facilitates interpretation and refinement of the ULCA results. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of this framework.},

Accurate detection of COPD subtypes by image biomarkers are urgently needed to enable individualized treatment thus improving patient outcome. We adapted the Parametric Response Map (PRM), a voxel-wise image analysis technique, for assessing COPD phenotype. We analyzed whole lung CT scans of 194 COPD individuals acquired at inspiration and expiration from the COPDGene Study. PRM identified the extent of functional small airways disease (fSAD) and emphysema as well as provided CT-based evidence that supports the concept that fSAD precedes emphysema with increasing COPD severity. PRM is a versatile imaging biomarker capable of diagnosing disease extent and phenotype, while providing detailed spatial information of disease distribution and location. PRMs ability to differentiate between specific COPD phenotypes will allow for more accurate diagnosis of individual patients complementing standard clinical techniques.},

The latter offers the capacity to rationalize, understand and use big data to serve many different purposes, from improved services modelling to prediction of treatment outcomes, to greater patient and disease stratification. In the area of infectious diseases, the application of big data analytics has introduced a number of changes in the information accumulation models. These are discussed by comparing the traditional and new models of data accumulation. Big data analytics is fast becoming a crucial component for the modelling of transmission—aiding infection control measures and policies—emergency response analyses required during local or international outbreaks. However, the application of big data analytics in infectious diseases is coupled with a number of ethical impacts. Four key areas are discussed in this paper: (i) automation and algorithmic reliance impacting freedom of choice, (ii) big data analytics complexity impacting informed consent, (iii) reliance on profiling impacting individual and group identities and justice/fair access and (iv) increased surveillance and population intervention capabilities impacting behavioural norms and practices. Furthermore, the extension of big data analytics to include information derived from personal devices, such as mobile phones and wearables as part of infectious disease frameworks in the near future and their potential ethical impacts are discussed. Considered together, the need for a constructive and transparent inclusion of ethical questioning in this rapidly evolving field becomes an increasing necessity in order to provide a moral foundation for the societal acceptance and responsible development of the technological advancement.},

Although, defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is the common final pathway, it is unknown why different mtDNA or nuclear mutations result in largely heterogeneous and often tissue -specific clinical presentations. Mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations are frequent causes of mitochondrial diseases both in children and adults. However numerous nuclear mutations involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis affecting ubiquitously expressed genes have been reported in association with very tissue specific clinical manifestations suggesting that there are so far unknown factors determining the tissue specificity in mitochondrial translation. Most of these gene defects result in histological abnormalities and multiple respiratory chain defects in the affected organs. The clinical phenotypes are usually early-onset, severe, and often fatal, implying the importance of mitochondrial translation from birth. However, some rare, reversible infantile mitochondrial diseases are caused by very specific defects of mitochondrial translation. An unbiased genetic approach (whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing) combined with proteomics and functional studies revealed novel factors involved in mitochondrial translation which contribute to the clinical manifestation and recovery in these rare reversible mitochondrial conditions.},

  abstract = {The last decade has provided abundant data implicating the WNT pathway in bone development and in the regulation of skeletal homeostasis. Rare human mutations together with gain- and loss-of-function approaches in mice have clearly demonstrated that disrupted regulation of this pathway leads to altered bone mass. In addition to these rare human and mice mutations, large population-based genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in B60 loci strongly associated with variations in bone mineral density (BMD) at different skeletal sites. Among the loci/genes identified by BMD GWAS, components of the WNT signaling pathway are numerous and have been shown to contribute to skeletal development and homeostasis. Within the components of WNTsignaling, the gene coding for WNT16, one of the 19 WNT ligands of the human genome, has been found strongly associated with specific bone traits such as cortical bone thickness, cortical porosity and fracture risk. Recently, the first functional characterization of Wnt16 has confirmed the critical role of Wnt16 in the regulation of cortical bone mass and bone strength in mice. These reports have extended our understanding of Wnt16 function in bone homeostasis and have not only confirmed the unique association of Wnt16 with cortical bone and fracture susceptibility, as suggested by GWAS in human populations, but have also provided novel insights into the biology of this WNT ligand and the mechanism(s) by which it regulates cortical but not trabecular bone homeostasis. Most interestingly, Wnt16 appears to be a strong anti-resorptive soluble factor acting on both osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Bioinformatic research relies on large-scale computational infrastructures which have a non-zero carbon footprint. So far, no study has quantified the environmental costs of bioinformatic tools and commonly run analyses. In this study, we estimate the bioinformatic carbon footprint (in kilograms of CO             2             equivalent units, kgCO             2             e) using the freely available Green Algorithms calculator (             www.green-algorithms.org             ). We assess (i) bioinformatic approaches in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing, genome assembly, metagenomics, phylogenetics and molecular simulations, as well as (ii) computation strategies, such as parallelisation, CPU (central processing unit) vs GPU (graphics processing unit), cloud vs. local computing infrastructure and geography. In particular, for GWAS, we found that biobank-scale analyses emitted substantial kgCO             2             e and simple software upgrades could make GWAS greener, e.g. upgrading from BOLT-LMM v1 to v2.3 reduced carbon footprint by 73\%. Switching from the average data centre to a more efficient data centres can reduce carbon footprint by \textasciitilde 34\%. Memory over-allocation can be a substantial contributor to an algorithm’s carbon footprint. The use of faster processors or greater parallelisation reduces run time but can lead to, sometimes substantially, greater carbon footprint. Finally, we provide guidance on how researchers can reduce power consumption and minimise kgCO             2             e. Overall, this work elucidates the carbon footprint of common analyses in bioinformatics and provides solutions which empower a move toward greener research.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Open source and open data have been driving forces in bioinformatics in the past. However, privacy concerns may soon change the landscape, limiting future access to important data sets, including personal genomics data. Here we survey this situation in some detail, describing, in particular, how the large scale of the data from personal genomic sequencing makes it especially hard to share data, exacerbating the privacy problem. We also go over various aspects of genomic privacy: first, there is basic identifiability of subjects having their genome sequenced. However, even for individuals who have consented to be identified, there is the prospect of very detailed future characterization of their genotype, which, unanticipated at the time of their consent, may be more personal and invasive than the release of their medical records. We go over various computational strategies for dealing with the issue of genomic privacy. One can ‘‘slice’’ and reformat datasets to allow them to be partially shared while securing the most private variants. This is particularly applicable to functional genomics information, which can be largely processed without variant information. For handling the most private data there are a number of legal and technological approaches—for example, modifying the informed consent procedure to acknowledge that privacy cannot be guaranteed, and/or employing a secure cloud computing environment. Cloud computing in particular may allow access to the data in a more controlled fashion than the current practice of downloading and computing on large datasets. Furthermore, it may be particularly advantageous for small labs, given that the burden of many privacy issues falls disproportionately on them in comparison to large corporations and genome centers. Finally, we discuss how education of future genetics researchers will be important, with curriculums emphasizing privacy and data security. However, teaching personal genomics with identifiable subjects in the university setting will, in turn, create additional privacy issues and social conundrums.},

  abstract = {Abstract | DNA methylation is of paramount importance for mammalian embryonic development. DNA methylation has numerous functions: it is implicated in the repression of transposons and genes, but is also associated with actively transcribed gene bodies and, in some cases, with gene activation per~se. In recent years, sensitive technologies have been developed that allow the interrogation of DNA methylation patterns from a small number of cells. The use of these technol­ ogies has greatly improved our knowledge of DNA methylation dynamics and heterogeneity in embryos and in specific tissues. Combined with genetic analyses, it is increasingly apparent that regulation of DNA methylation erasure and (re­)establishment varies considerably between different developmental stages. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and functions of DNA methylation and demethylation in both mice and humans at CpG­rich promoters, gene bodies and transposable elements. We highlight the dynamic erasure and re­establishment of DNA methylation in embryonic, germline and somatic cell development. Finally, we provide insights into DNA methylation gained from studying genetic diseases.},

These responses, called RNA interference or post-transcriptional gene silencing, may provide anti-viral defence, modulate transposition or regulate gene expression1,6,8–10. We have taken a biochemical approach towards elucidating the mechanisms underlying this genetic phenomenon. Here we show that ‘loss-of-function’ phenotypes can be created in cultured Drosophila cells by transfection with specific double-stranded RNAs. This coincides with a marked reduction in the level of cognate cellular messenger RNAs. Extracts of transfected cells contain a nuclease activity that specifically degrades exogenous transcripts homologous to transfected double-stranded RNA. This enzyme contains an essential RNA component. After partial purification, the sequence-specific nuclease co-fractionates with a discrete, ,25-nucleotide RNA species which may confer specificity to the enzyme through homology to the substrate mRNAs.},

However, Caucasian and Mexican-American subjects had similar FVC and FEV1 values with respect to height, and AfricanAmerican subjects had lower values. These differences may be partially due to differences in body build: observed Mexican-Americans were shorter than Caucasian subjects of the same age, and African-Americans on average have a smaller trunk:leg ratio than do Caucasians.

  abstract = {Due to modern biochemistry and, in particular, recent developments in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics, human samples (organs, tissues, cells, genes, etc.) have become the most important raw materials for advancement in the health sciences. Such material has been at the center of fundamental biomedical research for a long time. What is new is its increased usefulness in research with direct clinical relevance, such as the development of drugs. Because of the larger commercial involvement in such research, this has also led to greater economic interests in human biological material and in the information that can be extracted from it. Classical distinctions between different types of biological materials, such as organs, tissues, cells, and molecules, have to be reconsidered in the light of ongoing biotechnological developments. In particular, the therapeutic use of pluripotent cells makes the distinction between organs, tissues, and cells less relevant in some applications.1 Similarly, DNA sequencing makes the distinction between biological material and the information obtainable from it less clear. For many purposes, it is no longer important if one has the actual DNA or the information about its composition. DNA information from populations is currently one of the most important forms of biobanks. DNA can be obtained with simple methods, such as mouth washing, that are suitable for mass collection of samples. The value of a DNA bank increases with the social and medical information to which it is coupled. If it is combined, for instance, with electronic health records for each subject, then correlations can be searched for between genes, environmental (“lifestyle”) factors, and illness. Because both genetic and lifestyle information is privacy sensitive, the requirements of privacy and security in such research are substantial. The present contribution provides an overview of the ethical issues that are connected with the collection and use of biobanks. After a brief summary of current practices, a systematic review is made of the three major groups of ethical issues put forth. I then discuss the need for internationally harmonized regulations and a stronger focus on patient perspectives in future discussions on biobank ethics.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.                                         Results               To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.                                         Conclusions                                GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data. GSVA is an open source software package for R which forms part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded at                 http://www.bioconductor.org                 .},

  abstract = {Abstract The earliest morphologic evidence of changes in the airways associated with chronic cigarette smoking is in the small airways. To help understand how smoking modifies small airway structure and function, we developed a strategy using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and brushing to sample the human small airway (10th–12th order) bronchial epithelium to assess gene expression (Affymetrix HGU133A and HG-133 Plus 2.0 array) in phenotypically normal smokers (n=16, 25±7 pack-years) compared to matched nonsmokers (n=17). Compared to samples from large (second to third order) bronchi, the small airway samples had a higher proportion of ciliated cells, but less basal, undifferentiated, and secretory cells, and contained Clara cells. Even though the smokers were phenotypically normal, microarray analysis of gene expression of the small airway epithelium of the smokers compared to the nonsmokers demonstrated up- and downregulation of genes in multiple categories relevant to the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), including genes coding for cytokines/innate immunity, apoptosis, mucin, response to oxidants and xenobiotics, and general cellular processes. In the context that COPD starts in the small airways, these gene expression changes in the small airway epithelium in phenotypically normal smokers are candidates for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent the onset of COPD.},

The chronic exposure of pulmonary DNA to a multitude of metabolically activated carcinogens is consistent with our current understanding of cancer as a disease resulting from many changes in key genes regulating growth. This review illustrates how this solid foundation of knowledge can be used to find new ways to prevent lung cancer. Three prevention-related topics are discussed: human uptake of tobacco carcinogens as a way of assessing risk and investigating mechanisms; individual differences in the metabolic activation and detoxification of carcinogens, which may relate to cancer susceptibility; and chemoprevention of lung cancer in smokers and exsmokers. These new approaches are necessary as adjuncts to education and cessation efforts, which despite some success have not eliminated tobacco smoking.},

Unliganded GR is predominantly localized within the cytoplasm but rapidly and efficiently translocates to the nucleus following hormone binding. This review will focus on the intracellular signaling pathway utilized by the GR including the mechanisms that control its intracellular trafficking, hormone binding and transcriptional regulation. Many receptor-interacting proteins are involved in distinct steps in GR signal transduction, each with a unique mechanism to regulate receptor action and providing potential drug targets for the manipulation of cellular responses to glucocorticoids.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: Exacerbations of allergic asthma are often triggered by respiratory viral infections. We have previously shown that in a T-helper type 2 (Th2)-biased cytokine environment, mouse and human airway epithelial cells (AEC) exhibit increased expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral genes in response to synthetic double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), a virus-like stimulus. This implies coordinated regulation of gene expression, suggesting possible involvement of microRNA. To investigate this, we developed a novel approach to identifying candidate microRNA using online databases, then confirmed their expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Methods: Using a list of genes of interest, defined on the basis of the previous study as being up-regulated in a Th2 environment, we searched mouse and human microRNA databases for possible regulatory microRNA, and selected 10 candidates that were conserved across species or predicted by more than one human database. Expression of these microRNA was tested by qRT-PCR, in primary human AEC pre-treated with Th2 cytokines and exposed to dsRNA. Results: Expression of hsa-miR-139-5p, miR-423-5p and miR-542-3p was significantly decreased in Th2 pre-treated AEC, and miR-135a-5p exhibited a trend towards decreased expression. Further database searches confirmed that these microRNA regulated additional pro-inflammatory and anti-viral response genes for which expression had previously been shown to be up-regulated, confirming the validity of this approach. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the value of using multiple online databases to identify candidate regulatory microRNA and provides the first evidence that in an allergic environment, microRNA may be important in altering the pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses of human AEC during exacerbations of asthma.},

Epidemiological and pathological studies suggest that silica dust exposure can lead to COPD, even in the absence of radiological signs of silicosis, and that the association between cumulative silica dust exposure and airflow obstruction is independent of silicosis. Recent clinicopathological and experimental studies have contributed further towards explaining the potential mechanism through which silica can cause pathological changes that may lead to the development of COPD. In this paper we review the epidemiological and pathological evidence relevant to the development of COPD in silica dust exposed workers within the context of recent findings. The evidence surveyed suggests that chronic levels of silica dust that do not cause disabling silicosis may cause the development of chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and/or small airways disease that can lead to airflow obstruction, even in the absence of radiological silicosis.},

  abstract = {The airflow limitation that defines chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the result of a prolonged time constant for lung emptying, caused by increased resistance of the small conducting airways and increased compliance of the lung as a result of emphysematous destruction. These lesions are associated with a chronic innate and adaptive inflammatory immune response of the host to a lifetime exposure to inhaled toxic gases and particles. Processes contributing to obstruction in the small conducting airways include disruption of the epithelial barrier, interference with mucociliary clearance apparatus that results in accumulation of inflammatory mucous exudates in the small airway lumen, infiltration of the airway walls by inflammatory cells, and deposition of connective tissue in the airway wall. This remodelling and repair thickens the airway walls, reduces lumen calibre, and restricts the normal increase in calibre produced by lung inflation. Emphysematous lung destruction is associated with an infiltration of the same type of inflammatory cells found in the airways. The centrilobular pattern of emphysematous destruction is most closely associated with cigarette smoking, and although it is initially focused on respiratory bronchioles, separate lesions coalesce to destroy large volumes of lung tissue. The panacinar pattern of emphysema is characterised by a more even involvement of the acinus and is associated with  1 antitrypsin deficiency. The technology needed to diagnose and quantitate the individual small airway and emphysema phenotypes present in people with COPD is being developed, and should prove helpful in the assessment of therapeutic interventions designed to modify the progress of either phenotype.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation and emphysema, and is caused by exposure to noxious particles or gases, e.g. cigarette smoke. Smoking and oxidative stress lead to accelerated formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), causing local tissue damage either directly or by binding the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). This study assessed the association of AGEs or RAGE in plasma, sputum, bronchial biopsies and skin with COPD and lung function, and their variance between these body compartments. Methods: Healthy smoking and never-smoking controls (n = 191) and COPD patients (n = 97, GOLD stage I-IV) were included. Autofluorescence (SAF) was measured in the skin, AGEs (pentosidine, CML and CEL) and sRAGE in blood and sputum by ELISA, and in bronchial biopsies by immunohistochemistry. eQTL analysis was performed in bronchial biopsies. Results: COPD patients showed higher SAF values and lower plasma sRAGE levels compared to controls and these values associated with decreased lung function (p {$<$}0.001; adjusting for relevant covariates). Lower plasma sRAGE levels significantly and independently predicted higher SAF values (p {$<$} 0.001). One SNP (rs2071278) was identified within a region of 50 kB flanking the AGER gene, which was associated with the gene and protein expression levels of AGER and another SNP (rs2071278) which was associated with the accumulation of AGEs in the skin. Conclusion: In COPD, AGEs accumulate differentially in body compartments, i.e. they accumulate in the skin, but not in plasma, sputum and bronchial biopsies. The association between lower sRAGE and higher SAF levels supports the hypothesis that the protective mechanism of sRAGE as a decoy-receptor is impaired in COPD.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation caused by ongoing inflammatory and remodeling processes of the airways and lung tissue. Inflammation can be targeted by corticosteroids. However, airway inflammation is generally less responsive to steroids in COPD than in asthma. The underlying mechanisms are yet unclear. This study aimed to assess whether skin corticosteroid insensitivity is associated with COPD and COPD severity using the corticosteroid skin blanching test. Methods: COPD patients GOLD stage I–IV (n = 27, 24, 22, and 16 respectively) and healthy never-smokers and smokers (n = 28 and 56 respectively) were included. Corticosteroid sensitivity was assessed by the corticosteroid skin blanching test. Budesonide was applied in 8 logarithmically increasing concentrations (0–100 mg/ml) on subject’s forearm. Assessment of blanching was performed after 7 hours using a 7-point scale (normal skin to intense blanching). All subjects performed spirometry and body plethysmography. Results:Both GOLD III and GOLD IV COPD patients showed significantly lower skin blanching responses than healthy neversmokers and smokers, GOLD I, and GOLD II patients. Their area under the dose-response curve values of the skin blanching response were 586 and 243 vs. 1560, 1154, 1380, and 1309 respectively, p,0.05. Lower FEV1 levels and higher RV/TLC ratios were significantly associated with lower skin blanching responses (p = 0.001 and p = 0.004 respectively). GOLD stage I, II, III and IV patients had similar age and packyears. Conclusions: In this study, severe and very severe COPD patients had lower skin corticosteroid sensitivity than mild and moderate COPD patients and non-COPD controls with comparable age and packyears. Our findings together suggest that the reduced skin blanching response fits with a subgroup of COPD patients that has an early-onset COPD phenotype.},

Serum CEA levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, with the upper limit of normal defined as 6.7 ng/mL based on the 95\% specificity level for benign lung disease in our hospital. Patients with serum CEA {$>$} or = 6.7 ng/mL (n = 9) were more likely to have advanced disease at surgery than those with serum CEA {$<$} 6.7 ng/mL (n = 30) (77.8\% vs 16.7\%, p = 0.0049). This increase in disease stage at surgery was mainly due to mediastinal lymph node metastasis. The sensitivity and specificity of serum CEA in the detection of pathological N2 disease were 62.5\% and 87.1\%, respectively. Survival for the high CEA group was significantly worse than that for the low CEA group (median survival time, 40.2 vs 75.8 months, p = 0.0125). Relapse-free survival for the high CEA group was also poorer than that of the low CEA group (p = 0.0032). In a multivariate analysis, serum CEA level was the most dominant factor affecting relapse-free survival (hazard ratio = 6.68, p = 0.0053). These findings suggest that preoperative serum CEA level is useful not only in detection of mediastinal lymph node metastasis, but also in prediction of survival for clinical-stage I patients with NSCLC.},

  abstract = {The pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of proteins which primarily defines tissue architecture and regulates various biochemical and biophysical processes. It is a dynamic system comprising two main structures (the interstitial matrix and the basement membrane) which undergo continuous, yet highly regulated, remodelling. This remodelling process is essential for tissue homeostasis and uncontrolled regulation can lead to pathological states including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Altered expression of ECM proteins, as observed in COPD, can contribute to the degradation of alveolar walls and thickening of the small airways which can cause limitations in airflow. Modifications in ECM composition can also impact immune cell migration and retention in the lung with migrating cells becoming entrapped in the diseased airspaces. Furthermore, ECM changes affect the lung microbiome, aggravating and advancing disease progression. A dysbiosis in bacterial diversity can lead to infection, inducing epithelial injury and pro-inflammatory reactions. Here we review the changes noted in the different ECM components in COPD and discuss how an imbalance in microbial commensalism can impact disease development.},

  abstract = {Background During the past 5 years, high-throughput technologies have been successfully used by epidemiology studies, but almost all have focused on sequence variation through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Today, the study of other genomic events is becoming more common in large-scale epidemiological studies. Many of these, unlike the single-nucleotide polymorphism studied in GWAS, are continuous measures. In this context, the exercise of searching for regions of interest for disease is akin to the problems described in the statistical ‘bump hunting’ literature. Methods New statistical challenges arise when the measurements are continuous rather than categorical, when they are measured with uncertainty, and when both biological signal, and measurement errors are characterized by spatial correlation along the genome. Perhaps the most challenging complication is that continuous genomic data from large studies are measured throughout long periods, making them susceptible to ‘batch effects’. An example that combines all three characteristics is genome-wide DNA methylation measurements. Here, we present a data analysis pipeline that effectively models measurement error, removes batch effects, detects regions of interest and attaches statistical uncertainty to identified regions. Results We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by detecting genomic regions of DNA methylation associated with a continuous trait in a well-characterized population of newborns. Additionally, we show that addressing unexplained heterogeneity like batch effects reduces the number of false-positive regions. Conclusions Our framework offers a comprehensive yet flexible approach for identifying genomic regions of biological interest in large epidemiological studies using quantitative high-throughput methods.},

  abstract = {Asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) are both inflammatory conditions of the lung associated with structural “remodeling” inappropriate to the maintenance of normal lung function. The clinically observed distinctions between asthma and COPD are reflected by differences in the remodeling process, the patterns of inflammatory cells and cytokines, and also the predominant anatomic site at which these alterations occur. In asthma the epithelium appears to be more fragile than that of COPD, the epithelial reticular basement membrane (RBM) is significantly thicker, there is marked enlargement of the mass of bronchial smooth muscle, and emphysema does not occur in the asthmatic nonsmoker. In COPD, there is epithelial mucous metaplasia, airway wall fibrosis, and inflammation associated with loss of surrounding alveolar attachments to the outer wall of small airways: bronchiolar smooth muscle is increased also. Emphysema is a feature of severe COPD: in spite of the destructive process, alveolar wall thickening and focal fibrosis may be detected. The hypertrophy of submucosal mucus-secreting glands is similar in extent in asthma and COPD. The number of bronchial vessels and the area of the wall occupied by them increase in severe corticosteroid-dependent asthma: it is likely that these increases also occur in severe COPD as they do in bronchiectasis. Pulmonary vasculature is remodeled in COPD. In asthma several of these structural alterations begin early in the disease process, even in the child. In COPD the changes begin later in life and the associated inflammatory response differs from that in asthma. The following synopsis defines and compares the key remodeling processes and proposes several hypotheses.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: There is need for a validated short, simple instrument to quantify chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) impact in routine practice to aid health status assessment and communication between patient and physician. Current health-related quality of life questionnaires provide valid assessment of COPD, but are complex, which limits routine use. The aim of the present study was to develop a short validated patient-completed questionnaire, the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), assessing the impact of COPD on health status. 21 candidate items identified through qualitative research with COPD patients were used in three prospective international studies (Europe and the USA, n51,503). Psychometric and Rasch analyses identified eight items fitting a unidimensional model to form the CAT. Items were tested for differential functioning between countries. Internal consistency was excellent: Cronbach’s a50.88. Test re-test in stable patients (n553) was very good (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.8). In the sample from the USA, the correlation with the COPD-specific version of the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire was r50.80. The difference between stable (n5229) and exacerbation patients (n567) was five units of the 40-point scale (12\%; p,0.0001). The CAT is a short, simple questionnaire for assessing and monitoring COPD. It has good measurement properties, is sensitive to differences in state and should provide a valid, reliable and standardised measure of COPD health status with worldwide relevance.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort               1–4               , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined               5               , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences               6,7               . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’               8               —has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years               9               . Despite recent progress               10–14               , existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)               15               , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the lung plays several important roles in lung function, as it offers a low resistant pathway that allows the exchange of gases, provides compressive strength and elasticity that supports the fragile alveolar–capillary intersection, controls the binding of cells with growth factors and cell surface receptors and acts as a buffer against retention of water.             COPD is a chronic inflammatory respiratory condition, characterised by various conditions that result in progressive airflow limitation. At any stage in the course of the disease, acute exacerbations of COPD may occur and lead to accelerated deterioration of pulmonary function. A key factor of COPD is airway remodelling, which refers to the serious alterations of the ECM affecting airway wall thickness, resistance and elasticity. Various studies have shown that serum biomarkers of ECM turnover are significantly associated with disease severity in patients with COPD and may serve as potential targets to control airway inflammation and remodelling in COPD. Unravelling the complete molecular composition of the ECM in the diseased lungs will help to identify novel biomarkers for disease progression and therapy.},

Inhibitors of PDE5A such as sildenafil are widely used to treat erectile dysfunction, but growing evidence supports important roles for the enzyme in both the vasculature and heart. In disorders such as cardiac failure, PDE5A upregulation may contribute to a decline in cGMP and protein kinase G signaling, exacerbating dysfunction. PDE5A plays an important role in the pulmonary vasculature where its inhibition benefits patients with pulmonary hypertension. In the heart, PDE5A signaling appears compartmentalized, and its inhibition is cardioprotective against ischemia-reperfusion and antracycline toxicity, blunts acute adrenergic contractile stimulation, and can suppress chronic hypertrophy and dysfunction attributable to pressure-overload. In this review, we discuss the molecular biology, pharmacology, and physiology of PDE5A, mechanisms of vascular and cardiac regulation, and recent evidence supporting the utility of selective PDE5A inhibition for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders.},

The majority of these deaths occur in low and middle‐income countries. Children, women, the elderly and people with underlying chronic conditions are most affected. In addition to reduced lung function, children exposed to biomass smoke have an increased risk of developing lower respiratory tract infections and asthma-related symptoms. In adults, chronic exposure to biomass smoke, ambient air pollution, and opportunistic exposure to fumes and dust are associated with an increased risk of developing chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and respiratory infections, including tuberculosis. Here, we review the evidence of prevalence of COPD in people exposed to non-cigarette smoke. We highlight mechanisms that are likely involved in biomass-smoke exposure-related COPD and other lung diseases. Finally, we summarize the potential preventive and therapeutic strategies for management of COPD induced by non-cigarette smoke exposure.},

  abstract = {The COPD Patient Management European Trial (COMET) investigated the efficacy and safety of a home-based COPD disease management intervention for severe COPD patients. The study was an international open-design clinical trial in COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s {$<$}50\% of predicted value) randomised 1:1 to the disease management intervention or to the usual management practices at the study centre. The disease management intervention included a self-management programme, home telemonitoring, care coordination and medical management. The primary end-point was the number of unplanned all-cause hospitalisation days in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary end-points included acute care hospitalisation days, BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise) index and exacerbations. Safety end-points included adverse events and deaths. For the 157 (disease management) and 162 (usual management) patients eligible for ITT analyses, all-cause hospitalisation days per year (mean±sd) were 17.4±35.4 and 22.6±41.8, respectively (mean difference −5.3, 95\% CI −13.7 to −3.1; p=0.16). The disease management group had fewer per-protocol acute care hospitalisation days per year (p=0.047), a lower BODE index (p=0.01) and a lower mortality rate (1.9\% versus 14.2\%; p{$<$}0.001), with no difference in exacerbation frequency. Patient profiles and hospitalisation practices varied substantially across countries. The COMET disease management intervention did not significantly reduce unplanned all-cause hospitalisation days, but reduced acute care hospitalisation days and mortality in severe COPD patients.

Recent findings Large case–control studies as well as cohort studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for RF positive and anti-citrulline antibody with rheumatoid arthritis and that the risk diminishes only several years after cessation of smoking. Evidence exists that smoking is a risk factor also for systemic lupus erythematosus, and that the risk may be related to the presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies. Mechanistic studies are reviewed that suggest that smoking can trigger specific and potentially diseaseinducing immune reactions against citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid arthritis, and dsDNA in systemic lupus erythematosus, and it is suggested that the genetic context determines which immune reactions may be triggered by smoking. Summary Counselling against smoking should be mandatory in rheumatological practice both to patients and to their relatives. Studies on the mechanisms whereby smoking triggers rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may provide fundamental new knowledge about the cause and molecular pathogenesis of these diseases.},

  abstract = {Software to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms or related genetic variants has converged on the variant call format (VCF) as the output format of choice. This has created a need for tools to work with VCF files. While an increasing number of software exists to read VCF data, many only extract the genotypes without including the data associated with each genotype that describes its quality. We created the R package VCFR to address this issue. We developed a VCF file exploration tool implemented in the R language because R provides an interactive experience and an environment that is commonly used for genetic data analysis. Functions to read and write VCF files into R as well as functions to extract portions of the data and to plot summary statistics of the data are implemented. VCFR further provides the ability to visualize how various parameterizations of the data affect the results. Additional tools are included to integrate sequence (FASTA) and annotation data (GFF) for visualization of genomic regions such as chromosomes. Conversion functions translate data from the VCFR data structure to formats used by other R genetics packages. Computationally intensive functions are implemented in C++ to improve performance. Use of these tools is intended to facilitate VCF data exploration, including intuitive methods for data quality control and easy export to other R packages for further analysis. VCFR thus provides essential, novel tools currently not available in R.},

Here we introduce the accompanying R package,               gprofiler2               , developed to facilitate programmatic access to g:Profiler computations and databases via REST API. The               gprofiler2               package provides an easy-to-use functionality that enables researchers to incorporate functional enrichment analysis into automated analysis pipelines written in R. The package also implements interactive visualisation methods to help to interpret the enrichment results and to illustrate them for publications. In addition,               gprofiler2               gives access to the versatile gene/protein identifier conversion functionality in g:Profiler enabling to map between hundreds of different identifier types or orthologous species. The               gprofiler2               package is freely available at the               CRAN repository               .},

  abstract = {Motivation: One of the main goals of large scale methylation studies is to detect differentially methylated loci. One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach. Results: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches. Availability and Implementation: The methods have been implemented in R package seqlm that is available through Github: https://github.com/raivokolde/seqlm},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in the developed world and associated with a high individual and socioeconomic burden. Despite emerging preventive efforts and ongoing clinical trials, the frequency and mortality of COPD are expected to continue to rise over the next decades. COPD is defined as an irreversible expiratory airflow limitation, which is caused by various degrees of the following two main features: First, small airway disease (SAD), which includes airway inflammation and remodelling, and second, emphysema, which is characterised by airspace enlargement. The major risk factor for COPD is cigarette smoke exposure; however, the molecular mechanisms linking smoke to different COPD features on the cellular level remain elusive. The transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily constitutes more than 40 members, which are essential during organ development, a process often recapitulated in chronic diseases. Emerging interest in the role of TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of COPD has recently evolved, particularly since genetic studies have demonstrated an association of gene polymorphisms of the TGF-beta superfamily with COPD. In addition, increased expression of TGF-beta1 in COPD lungs and primary cells, such as epithelial cells, macrophages, or fibroblasts isolated from COPD specimens, was reported, suggesting an impact of TGF-beta signalling on the development and progression of COPD. Thus, targeted interventions of TGF-beta signalling may represent a suitable therapeutic option in COPD. In this review, we will summarise the current understanding of the impact of TGF-beta in COPD pathogenesis. The review is separated into five chapters: 1) an introduction to COPD, 2) an introduction to TGF-beta signalling, 3) a summary of TGF-beta gene polymorphisms in COPD, 4) a summary of TGF-beta signalling in small airway disease, and 5) a summary of TGF-beta signalling in emphysema.},

Compared to previous Sanger sequencing- and microarray-based methods, RNA-Seq provides far higher coverage and greater resolution of the dynamic nature of the transcriptome. Beyond quantifying gene expression, the data generated by RNA-Seq facilitate the discovery of novel transcripts, identification of alternatively spliced genes, and detection of allele-specific expression. Recent advances in the RNA-Seq workflow, from sample preparation to library construction to data analysis, have enabled researchers to further elucidate the functional complexity of the transcription. In addition to polyadenylated messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, RNA-Seq can be applied to investigate different populations of RNA, including total RNA, pre-mRNA, and noncoding RNA, such as microRNA and long ncRNA. This article provides an introduction to RNA-Seq methods, including applications, experimental design, and technical challenges.},

However, the available protocols for construction of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) libraries are expensive and/or difficult to scale for high-throughput applications. Also, most protocols require isolated total RNA as a starting point. We provide a cost-effective RNA-Seq library synthesis protocol that is fast, starts with tissue, and is high-throughput from tissue to synthesized library. We have also designed and report a set of 96 unique barcodes for library adapters that are amenable to high-throughput sequencing by a large combination of multiplexing strategies. Our developed protocol has more power to detect differentially expressed genes when compared to the standard Illumina protocol, probably owing to less technical variation amongst replicates. We also address the problem of gene-length biases affecting differential gene expression calls and demonstrate that such biases can be efficiently minimized during mRNA isolation for library preparation.},

  abstract = {Abstract | Mitochondria are cellular organelles responsible for generation of chemical energy in the process called oxidative phosphorylation. They originate from a bacterial ancestor and maintain their own genome, which is expressed by designated, mitochondrial transcription and translation machineries that differ from those operating for nuclear gene expression. In particular, the mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery is structurally and functionally very different from that governing eukaryotic, cytosolic translation. Despite harbouring their own genetic information, mitochondria are far from being independent of the rest of the cell and, conversely, cellular fitness is closely linked to mitochondrial function. Mitochondria depend heavily on the import of nuclear-encoded proteins for gene expression and function, and hence engage in extensive inter-compartmental crosstalk to regulate their proteome. This connectivity allows mitochondria to adapt to changes in cellular conditions and also mediates responses to stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. With a focus on mammals and yeast, we review fundamental insights that have been made into the biogenesis, architecture and mechanisms of the mitochondrial translation apparatus in the past years owing to the emergence of numerous near-atomic structures and a considerable amount of biochemical work. Moreover, we discuss how cellular mitochondrial protein expression is regulated, including aspects of mRNA and tRNA maturation and stability, roles of auxiliary factors, such as translation regulators, that adapt mitochondrial translation rates, and the importance of inter-compartmental crosstalk with nuclear gene expression and cytosolic translation and how it enables integration of mitochondrial translation into the cellular context.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously observed that 30 months of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment can attenuate FEV1 decline in COPD, but it is unclear whether withdrawal induces a relapse. We hypothesized that FEV1 decline, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and quality of life (QOL) deteriorate after ICS cessation even after prolonged use. METHODS: One hundred fourteen patients with moderate to severe COPD finished randomized 6-month or 30-month treatment with fluticasone (500 mg bid), 30-month treatment with fl uticasone and salmeterol (500/50mg bid), or placebo (first part of the Groningen and Leiden Universities Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease [GLUCOLD] study [GL1]). The subsequent 5 years, patients were prospectively followed annually, treated by their physician (GLUCOLD follow-up study [GL2]). Postbronchodilator FEV1, AHR, and QOL were initially recorded at baseline, at 30 months (GL1), and annually during GL2. Analysis was performed by linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Among 101 adherent patients during GL1, 79 patients started and 58 completed GL2. Patients using ICSs during GL1, but only using ICSs 0\% to 50\% of the time during GL2 (n 5 56 of 79), had significantly accelerated annual FEV1 decline compared with GL1 (difference GL2-GL1 [95\% CI]: 30-month treatment with fluticasone and salmeterol, 268 mL/y [2112 to 225], P 5 .002; 30-month treatment with fluticasone, 273 mL/y [2119 to 226], P 5 .002), accompanied by deterioration in AHR and QOL. CONCLUSIONS: ICS discontinuation after 30 months in COPD can worsen lung function decline, AHR, and QOL during 5-year follow-up. This suggests that ICS treatment lacks sustained disease-modifying effect after treatment cessation.},

  abstract = {Rationale: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease driven by diverse immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms. Objectives: Using transcriptomic profiling of airway tissues, we sought to define the molecular phenotypes of severe asthma. Methods: The transcriptome derived from bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushings of 107 subjects with moderate to severe asthma were annotated by gene set variation analysis using 42 gene signatures relevant to asthma, inflammation, and immune function. Topological data analysis of clinical and histologic data was performed to derive clusters, and the nearest shrunken centroid algorithm was used for signature refinement. Measurements and Main Results: Nine gene set variation analysis signatures expressed in bronchial biopsies and airway epithelial brushings distinguished two distinct asthma subtypes associated with high expression of T-helper cell type 2 cytokines and lack of corticosteroid response (group 1 and group 3). Group 1 had the highest submucosal eosinophils, as well as high fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, exacerbation rates, and oral corticosteroid use, whereas group 3 patients showed the highest levels of sputum eosinophils and had a high body mass index. In contrast, group 2 and group 4 patients had an 86\% and 64\% probability, respectively, of having noneosinophilic inflammation. Using machine learning tools, we describe an inference scheme using the currently available inflammatory biomarkers sputum eosinophilia and fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels, along with oral corticosteroid use, that could predict the subtypes of gene expression within bronchial biopsies and epithelial cells with good sensitivity and specificity. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of a transcriptomics-driven approach to phenotyping that segments patients who may benefit the most from specific agents that target T-helper cell type 2–mediated inflammation and/or corticosteroid insensitivity.},

  abstract = {Nicotine and its derivatives, by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs) on bronchial epithelial cells, can regulate cellular signaling and inflammatory processes. Delineation of nAChR subtypes and their responses to nicotine stimulation in bronchial epithelium may provide information for therapeutic targeting in smoking-related inflammation in the airway. Expression of nAChR subunit genes in 60 bronchial epithelial biopsies and immunohistochemical staining for the subcellular locations of nAChR subunit expression were evaluated. Seven human bronchial epithelial cell lines (HBECs) were exposed to nicotine in vitro for their response in nAChR subunit gene expression to nicotine exposure and removal. The relative normalized amount of expression of nAChR α4, α5, and α7 and immunohistochemical staining intensity of nAChR α4, α5, and β3 expression showed significant correlation with lung function parameters. Nicotine stimulation in HBECs resulted in transient increase in the levels of nAChR α5 and α6 but more sustained increase in nAChR α7 expression. nAChR expression in bronchial epithelium was found to correlate with lung function. Nicotine exposure in HBECs resulted in both short and longer term responses in nAChR subunit gene expression. These results gave insight into the potential of targeting nAChRs for therapy in smoking-related inflammation in the airway.},

We studied 7,764 men and women for 5 yrs. The subjects were grouped according to self-reported smoking habits during the observation period. We found that persistent cigarette smoking, in particular heavy smoking, accelerated the decline in FEV1. In 310 subjects who quitted smoking during the observation period, the decline of FEV1 was less pronounced than the decline observed in persistent smokers. In subjects younger than 55 yrs of age, smoking reduction was associated with a less pronounced FEV1 decline, while in the elderly subjects smoking reduction had no effect on the FEV1 decline. An increase in the number of cigarettes smoked was generally associated with a more rapid decline of FEV1, while the beginning of smoking during the 5 yrs of observation did not seem to influence the decline of FEV1. We conclude that smoking cessation or reduction may lead to a demonstrable beneficial effect on the FEV1 decline within a few years.},

  abstract = {Background: Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting Beta 2 agonists (LABAs) are used to treat moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Objective: To determine whether long-term ICS therapy, with and without LABAs, reduces inflammation and improves pulmonary function in COPD. Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00158847) Setting: 2 university medical centers in The Netherlands. Patients: 114 steroid-naive current or former smokers with moderate to severe COPD. Measurements: Cell counts in bronchial biopsies and sputum (primary outcome); methacholine responsiveness at baseline, 6, and 30 months; and clinical outcomes every 3 months. Intervention: Random assignment by minimization method to receive fluticasone propionate, 500 ug twice daily, for 6 months (n = 31) or 30 months (n = 26); fluticasone, 500 ug twice daily, and salmeterol, 50 ug twice daily, for 30 months (single inhaler; n = 28); or placebo twice daily (n = 29). Results: 101 patients were greater than 70\% adherent to therapy. Fluticasone therapy decreased counts of mucosal CD3+ cells (-55\% [95\% CI, -74\% to -22\%]; P =0.004), CD4+ cells (-78\% [CI, -88\% to 60\%]; P = 0.001), CD8+ cells (-57\% [CI, -77\% to -18\%]; P = 0.010), and mast cells (-38\% [CI, -60\% to -2\%]; P = 0.039) and reduced hyperresponsiveness (P = 0.036) versus placebo at 6 months, with effects maintained after 30 months. Fluticasone therapy for 30 months reduced mast cell count and increased eosinophil count and percentage of intact epithelium, with accompanying reductions in sputum neutrophil, macrophage, and lymphocyte counts and improvements in FEV1 decline, dyspnea, and quality of life. Reductions in inflammatory cells correlated with clinical improvements. Discontinuing fluticasone therapy at 6 months increased counts of CD3+ cells (120\% [CI, 24\% to 289\%]; P = 0.007), mast cells (218\% [CI, 99\% to 407\%]; P = 0.001), and plasma cells (118\% [CI, 9\% to 336\%]; P = 0.028) and worsened clinical outcome. Adding salmeterol improved FEV1 level. Limitations: The study was not designed to evaluate clinical outcomes. Measurement of primary outcome was not available for 24\% of patients at 30 months. Conclusion: ICS therapy decreases inflammation and can attenuate decline in lung function in steroid-naive patients with moderate to severe COPD. Adding LABAs does not enhance these effects.

  abstract = {Sensory nerves innervating the lung and airways play an important role in regulating various cardiopulmonary functions and maintaining homeostasis under both healthy and disease conditions. Their activities conducted by both vagal and sympathetic afferents are also responsible for eliciting important defense reflexes that protect the lung and body from potential health-hazardous effects of airborne particulates and chemical irritants. This article reviews the morphology, transduction properties, reflex functions, and respiratory sensations of these receptors, focusing primarily on recent findings derived from using new technologies such as neural immunochemistry, isolated airway-nerve preparation, cultured airway neurons, patch-clamp electrophysiology, transgenic mice, and other cellular and molecular approaches. Studies of the signal transduction of mechanosensitive afferents have revealed a new concept of sensory unit and cellular mechanism of activation, and identified additional types of sensory receptors in the lung. Chemosensitive properties of these lung afferents are further characterized by the expression of specific ligand-gated ion channels on nerve terminals, ganglion origin, and responses to the action of various inflammatory cells, mediators, and cytokines during acute and chronic airway inflammation and injuries. Increasing interest and extensive investigations have been focused on uncovering the mechanisms underlying hypersensitivity of these airway afferents, and their role in the manifestation of various symptoms under pathophysiological conditions. Several important and challenging questions regarding these sensory nerves are discussed. Searching for these answers will be a critical step in developing the translational research and effective treatments of airway diseases.},

Methods to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (clusters of neighboring probes associated with a phenotype) may provide more power to detect associations between DNA methylation and diseases or phenotypes of interest. Results: We proposed a novel approach, GlobalP, and perform comparisons with 3 methods—DMRcate, Bumphunter, and comb-p—to identify DMRs associated with log triglycerides (TGs) in real GAW20 data before and after fenofibrate treatment. We applied these methods to the summary statistics from an EWAS performed on the methylation data. Comb-p, DMRcate, and GlobalP detected very similar DMRs near the gene CPT1A on chromosome 11 in both the preand posttreatment data. In addition, GlobalP detected 2 DMRs before fenofibrate treatment in the genes ETV6 and ABCG1. Bumphunter identified several DMRs on chromosomes 1 and 20, which did not overlap with DMRs detected by other methods. Conclusions: Our novel method detected the same DMR identified by two existing methods and detected two additional DMRs not identified by any of the existing methods we compared.},

Results: Several methods had inflated Type I error, which increased at more stringent significant levels. In power simulations with 1–2 causal CpG sites with the same direction of effect, dmrff was consistently among the most powerful methods. Conclusion: This study illustrates the need for more thorough simulation studies when evaluating novel methods. More work must be done to develop methods with well-controlled Type I error that do not require individual-level data.},

  abstract = {Background—Asthma is characterized by increased airway narrowing in response to nonspecific stimuli. The disorder is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Exosomes are nanosized vesicles of endosomal origin released from inflammatory and epithelial cells that have been implicated in asthma. In this study we characterized the microRNA (miRNA) content of exosomes in healthy control subjects and patients with mild intermittent asthma both at unprovoked baseline and in response to environmental challenge. Objective—To investigate alterations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) exosomal miRNA profiles due to asthma, and following subway air exposure. Methods—Exosomes were isolated from BALF from healthy control subjects (n = 10) and patients with mild intermittent asthma (n = 10) after subway and control exposures. Exosomal RNA was analyzed by using microarrays containing probes for 894 human miRNAs, and selected findings were validated with quantitative RT-PCR. Results were analyzed by using multivariate modeling. Results—The presence of miRNAs was confirmed in exosomes from BALF of both asthmatic patients and healthy control subjects. Significant differences in BALF exosomal miRNA was detected for 24 miRNAs with a subset of 16 miRNAs, including members of the let-7 and miRNA-200 families, providing robust classification of patients with mild nonsymptomatic asthma from healthy subjects with 72\% cross-validated predictive power (Q2 = 0.72). In contrast, subway exposure did not cause any significant alterations in miRNA profiles. Conclusion—These studies demonstrate substantial differences in exosomal miRNA profiles between healthy subjects and patients with unprovoked, mild, stable asthma. These changes might be important in the inflammatory response leading to bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma.},

This article presents an easy-to-use method for constructing maximin distance designs. The method is versatile as it works with any distance measure. The basic idea is to construct large designs from small designs, and the method is effective because the quality of large designs is guaranteed by that of small designs, as evaluated by the maximin distance criterion.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in plants and animals1,2. To investigate the influence of miRNAs on transcript levels, we transfected miRNAs into human cells and used microarrays to examine changes in the messenger RNA profile. Here we show that delivering miR-124 causes the expression profile to shift towards that of brain, the organ in which miR-124 is preferentially expressed, whereas delivering miR-1 shifts the profile towards that of muscle, where miR-1 is preferentially expressed. In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The 3 0 untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity to pair to the 5 0 region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs3. Our results suggest that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts. Moreover, miR-1 and miR-124, and presumably other tissue-specific miRNAs, seem to downregulate a far greater number of targets than previously appreciated, thereby helping to define tissue-specific gene expression in humans.},

  abstract = {The regulation of telomere length in mammals is crucial for chromosome end-capping and thus for maintaining genome stability and cellular lifespan. This process requires coordination between telomeric protein complexes and the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, which extends the telomeric DNA. Telomeric proteins modulate telomere architecture, recruit telomerase to accessible telomeres and orchestrate the conversion of the newly synthesized telomeric single-stranded DNA tail into double-stranded DNA. Dysfunctional telomere maintenance leads to telomere shortening, which causes human diseases including bone marrow failure, premature ageing and cancer. Recent studies provide new insights into telomerase-related interactions (the ‘telomere replisome’) and reveal new challenges for future telomere structural biology endeavours owing to the dynamic nature of telomere architecture and the great number of structures that telomeres form. In this Review, we discuss recently determined structures of the shelterin and CTC1–STN1–TEN1 (CST) complexes, how they may participate in the regulation of telomere replication and chromosome end-capping, and how disease-causing mutations in their encoding genes may affect specific functions. Major outstanding questions in the field include how all of the telomere components assemble relative to each other and how the switching between different telomere structures is achieved.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the third most common cause of global mortality. Acute exacerbations of COPD frequently necessitate hospital admission to enable more intensive therapy, incurring significant healthcare costs. COPD exacerbations are also associated with accelerated lung function decline and increased risk of mortality. Until recently, bacterial pathogens were believed to be responsible for the majority of disease exacerbations. However, with the advent of culture-independent molecular diagnostic techniques it is now estimated that viruses are detected during half of all COPD exacerbations and are associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Human rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza are the most commonly detected viruses during exacerbation. The role of persistent viral infection (adenovirus) has also been postulated as a potential pathogenic mechanism in COPD. Viral pathogens may play an important role in driving COPD progression by acting as triggers for exacerbation and subsequent lung function decline whilst the role of chronic viral infection remains a plausible hypothesis that requires further evaluation. There are currently no effective antiviral strategies for patients with COPD. Herein, we focus on the current understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of respiratory viral infection in COPD.},

The cardiac function of Pde5a−/− mice was better than WT mice both at day 3 and 7 post MI. Immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry showed neutrophils and macrophages were decreased in Pde5a−/− mouse hearts. Inflammatory factors expression such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, Mcp-1, TNF-α significantly decreased in Pde5a−/− mice post MI. Moreover, western blot showed the inhibition of inflammatory response was accompanied by down-regulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1) in Pde5a−/− mice. Knockout of Pde5a reduced inflammatory cells infiltration by down-regulating the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and prevented early cardiac rupture after MI.

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality globally. Studies show that airway mucus hypersecretion strongly compromises lung function, leading to frequent hospitalization and mortality, highlighting an urgent need for effective COPD treatments. MUC5AC is known to contribute to severe muco-obstructive lung diseases, worsening COPD pathogenesis. Various pathways are implicated in the aberrant MUC5AC production and secretion MUC5AC. These include signaling pathways associated with mucus-secreting cell differentiation [nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)and IL-13-STAT6- SAM pointed domain containing E26 transformation-specific transcription factor (SPDEF), as well as epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)], and signaling pathways related to mucus transport and excretion-ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Various inhibitors of mucus hypersecretion are in clinical use but have had limited benefits against COPD. Thus, novel therapies targeting airway mucus hypersecretion should be developed for effective management of muco-obstructive lung disease. Here, we systematically review the mechanisms and pathogenesis of airway mucus hypersecretion, with emphasis on multi-target and multi-link intervention strategies for the elucidation of novel inhibitors of airway mucus hypersecretion.},

The miRNA profiles are surprisingly informative, reflecting the developmental lineage and differentiation state of the tumours. We observe a general downregulation of miRNAs in tumours compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, we were able to successfully classify poorly differentiated tumours using miRNA expression profiles, whereas messenger RNA profiles were highly inaccurate when applied to the same samples.

Methods: One thousand fifty-three patients (38.8\% female) evaluated for lung volume reduction surgery as part of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial were analyzed. Measurements and Main Results: Detailed clinical, physiological, and radiological assessment, including quantitation of emphysema severity and distribution from helical chest computed tomography, was completed. In a subgroup (n   101), airway size and thickness was determined by histological analyses of resected tissue. Women were younger and exhibited a lower body mass index (BMI), shorter smoking history, less severe airflow obstruction, lower DLCO and arterial PO2, higher arterial PCO2, shorter six-minute walk distance, and lower maximal wattage during oxygen-supplemented cycle ergometry. For a given FEV1\% predicted, age, number of packyears, and proportion of emphysema, women experienced greater dyspnea, higher modified BODE, more depression, lower SF-36 mental component score, and lower quality of well-being. Overall emphysema was less severe in women, with the difference from men most evident in the outer peel of the lung. Females had thicker small airway walls relative to luminal perimeters. Conclusions: In patients with severe COPD, women, relative to men, exhibit anatomically smaller airway lumens with disproportionately thicker airway walls, and emphysema that is less extensive and characterized by smaller hole size and less peripheral involvement.},

  abstract = {Bayesian Networks (BN) have been a popular predictive modeling formalism in bioinformatics, but their application in modern genomics has been slowed by an inability to cleanly handle domains with mixed discrete and continuous variables. Existing free BN software packages either discretize continuous variables, which can lead to information loss, or do not include inference routines, which makes prediction with the BN impossible. We present CGBayesNets, a BN package focused around prediction of a clinical phenotype from mixed discrete and continuous variables, which fills these gaps. CGBayesNets implements Bayesian likelihood and inference algorithms for the conditional Gaussian Bayesian network (CGBNs) formalism, one appropriate for predicting an outcome of interest from, e.g., multimodal genomic data. We provide four different network learning algorithms, each making a different tradeoff between computational cost and network likelihood. CGBayesNets provides a full suite of functions for model exploration and verification, including cross validation, bootstrapping, and AUC manipulation. We highlight several results obtained previously with CGBayesNets, including predictive models of wood properties from tree genomics, leukemia subtype classification from mixed genomic data, and robust prediction of intensive care unit mortality outcomes from metabolomic profiles. We also provide detailed example analysis on public metabolomic and gene expression datasets. CGBayesNets is implemented in MATLAB and available as MATLAB source code, under an Open Source license and anonymous download at http://www.cgbayesnets.com.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations are associated with viral infections. We wished to determine if respiratory viral infection of children in the community was associated with hospital admissions of patients with exacerbations of COPD. Methods: We collected data over a 45-month period from the Northern Ireland Regional Virus Laboratory and from a general hospital in the same locality. We studied the relationship between upper respiratory infections in children and COPD admissions. We also examined the role of school holidays. Results: Correlations were seen between the frequency of all viral infections in children and the number of adult COPD hospitalizations ðPo0:005Þ. Subgroup analysis showed distinct relationships with epidemics of; influenza A ðPo0:001Þ, influenza B ðPo0:05Þ, adenovirus ðP ¼ 0:05Þ, respiratory syncytial virus ðPo0:005Þ and hospital admissions of patients with COPD. There were significantly fewer COPD admissions in the week after the start of a school holiday period ðPo0:05Þ. Conclusions: When children are hospitalized with viral respiratory infection there is an associated rise in adult COPD admissions. This suggests exacerbations of COPD are associated with epidemics of respiratory viruses. When children are on school holidays there is a reduction in COPD admissions in the community. This provides further support for respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations.},

  abstract = {Most chronic and acute lung diseases have no cure, leaving lung transplantation as the only option. Recent work has improved our understanding of the endogenous regenerative capacity of the lung and has helped identification of different progenitor cell populations, as well as exploration into inducing endogenous regeneration through pharmaceutical or biological therapies. Additionally, alternative approaches that aim at replacing lung progenitor cells and their progeny through cell therapy, or whole lung tissue through bioengineering approaches, have gained increasing attention. Although impressive progress has been made, efforts at regenerating functional lung tissue are still ineffective. Chronic and acute lung diseases are most prevalent in the elderly and alterations in progenitor cells with ageing, along with an increased inflammatory milieu, present major roadblocks for regeneration. Multiple cellular mechanisms, such as cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction, are aberrantly regulated in the aged and diseased lung, which impairs regeneration. Existing as well as new human               in vitro               models are being developed, improved and adapted in order to study potential mechanisms of lung regeneration in different contexts. This review summarises recent advances in understanding endogenous as well as exogenous regeneration and the development of               in vitro               models for studying regenerative mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Cigarette smoking is the primary cause of the irreversible lung disease emphysema. Historically, inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils have been studied for their role in emphysema pathology. However, recent studies indicate that the lung epithelium is an active participant in emphysema pathogenesis and plays a critical role in the lung’s response to cigarette smoke. Tobacco smoke increases protease production and alters cytokine expression in isolated epithelial cells, suggesting that these cells respond potently even in the absence of a complete inflammatory program. Tobacco smoke also acts as an immunosuppressant, reducing the defense function of airway epithelial cells and enhancing colonization of the lower airways. Thus, the paradigm that emphysema is strictly an inflammatory-cell based disease is shifting to consider the involvement of resident epithelial cells. Here we review the role of epithelial cells in lung development and emphysema. To better understand tobacco-epithelial interactions we performed microarray analyses of RNA from human airway epithelial cells exposed to smoke extract for 24 hours. These studies identified differential regulation of 425 genes involved in diverse biological processes, such as apoptosis, immune function, cell cycle, signal transduction, proliferation, and antioxidants. Some of these genes, including VEGF, glutathione peroxidase, IL-13 receptor, and cytochrome P450, have been previously reported to be altered in the lungs of smokers. Others, such as pirin, cathepsin L, STAT1, and BMP2, are shown here for the first time to have a potential role in smoke-associated injury. These data broaden our understanding of the importance of epithelial cells in lung health and cigarette smoke-induced emphysema.},

  abstract = {Most pharmacologically active molecules are lipophilic and remain un-ionized or only partially ionized at physiological pH. Biotransformation means that a lipid-soluble xenobiotic or endobiotic compound is enzymatically transformed into polar, water-soluble, and excretable metabolites. The major organ for drug biotransformation is the liver The metabolic products often are less active than the parent drug or inactive. However, some biotransformation products (metabolites) may have enhanced activity or toxic effects. Thus biotransformation may include both "detoxication "" and "'toxication" processes. One of the major enzyme systems that determines the organism's capability of dealing with drugs and chemicals is represented by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Studies in the last 15 years have provided evidence that cytochrome P450 occurs in many different forms or "'isozymes" which differ in spectral chemical and immunological properties and have different substrate affinities. These isozymes also differ in their regulation and tissue distribution. Recombinant DNA studies indicate that between 40 and 60 structural genes code for different cytochrome P450 isozymes in a single organism. Other enzyme systems include dehydrogenases, oxidases, esterases, reductases, and a number of conjugating enzyme systems including glucuronosyltransferases, sulfotransferases, glutathione S-transferases, etc. Environmental and genetic factors cause interindividual and intraindividual differences in drug metabolism and may alter the balance between toxification and detoxification reactions. Genetic polymorphisms lead to subpopulations of patients with decreased, absent, or even increased activities of certain reactions (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP2C19, N-acetyhransferase polymorphism). Environmental factors such as other drugs, steroids, dietary factors, alcohol and cigarette smoke can induce or inhibit drug-metabolizing enzymes and cause intraindividual variation.},

This statement contains details about procedures that are common for many methods of lung function testing and, hence, are presented on their own. A list of abbreviations used in all the documents is also included as part of this statement. All terms and abbreviations used here are based on a report of the American College of Chest Physicians/ATS Joint Committee on Pulmonary Nomenclature 1. The metrology definitions agreed by the International Standards Organization (ISO) are recommended 2 and some important terms are defined as follows. Accuracy is the closeness of agreement between the result of a measurement and the conventional true value. Repeatability is the closeness of agreement between the results of successive measurements of the same item carried out, subject to all of the following conditions: same method, same observer, same instrument, same location, same condition of use, and repeated over a short space of time. In previous documents, the term reproducibility was used in this context, and this represents a change towards bringing this document in line with the ISO. Reproducibility is the closeness of agreement of the results of successive measurements of the same item where the individual measurements are carried out with changed conditions, such as: method of measurement, observer, instrument, location, conditions of use, and time.

We present a database of {$>$}270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5\% comprise long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain 15-17\% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype-phenotype map than previously anticipated.},

  abstract = {The quality of care can be improved by the development and implementation of evidence-based treatment guidelines. Different national guidelines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exist in Europe and relevant differences may exist among them.                            This was an evaluation of COPD treatment guidelines published in Europe and Russia in the past 7\hspace{0.25em}years. Each guideline was reviewed in detail and information about the most important aspects of patient diagnosis, risk stratification and pharmacotherapy was extracted following a standardised process. Guidelines were available from the Czech Republic, England and Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Sweden. The treatment goals, criteria for COPD diagnosis, consideration of comorbidities in treatment selection and support for use of long-acting bronchodilators, were similar across treatment guidelines. There were differences in measures used for stratification of disease severity, consideration of patient phenotypes, criteria for the use of inhaled corticosteroids and recommendations for other medications (               e.g.               theophylline and mucolytics) in addition to bronchodilators.                          There is generally good agreement on treatment goals, criteria for diagnosis of COPD and use of long-acting bronchodilators as the cornerstone of treatment among guidelines for COPD management in Europe and Russia. However, there are differences in the definitions of patient subgroups and other recommended treatments.},

We present an overview of the biomedical literature describing reported relationships between COPD symptoms and disease burden in terms of quality of life, health status, daily activities, physical activity, sleep, comorbid anxiety, and depression, as well as risk of exacerbations and disease prognosis. In addition, the substantial variability of COPD symptoms encountered (morning, daytime, and nighttime) is addressed and their implications for disease burden considered. The findings from this narrative review, which mainly focuses on real-world and observational studies, demonstrate the impact of COPD symptoms on the burden of disease and that improved recognition and understanding of their impact is central to alleviating this burden.},

The GOLD documents endeavor to incorporate latest evidence and expert consensus and are intended for use as “strategy documents” for implementation of effective care for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) on a global level. The GOLD 2018 report defines COPD as a “common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities, usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases,” with the criteria of “persistent respiratory symptoms” being a new and controversial inclusion since 2017. With the availability of newer pharmacotherapy options, treatment recommendations are made on the basis of a review of the latest literature and directed by symptom burden and health care utilization. Apart from the change in definition, a major shift in the recommen- dations is the exclusion of severity of airflow limitation as one of the major factors in guiding therapy. We review the salient features of the GOLD 2018 document and provide commentary on features that merit further discussion based on our clinical experience and practice as well as literature review current as of February 2018.},

Theoretically, such evolutionary complexification could occur through successive appearance of novel replicators that interact with one another to form replication networks. Here we perform long-term evolution experiments of RNA that replicates using a self-encoded RNA replicase. The RNA diversifies into multiple coexisting host and parasite lineages, whose frequencies in the population initially fluctuate and gradually stabilize. The final population, comprising five RNA lineages, forms a replicator network with diverse interactions, including cooperation to help the replication of all other members. These results support the capability of molecular replicators to spontaneously develop complexity through Darwinian evolution, a critical step for the emergence of life.},

However, the role of SERPINB10 in asthma remains unknown. We examined the association between epithelial SERPINB10 expression and airway eosinophilia in subjects with asthma and the role of Serpinb10 in allergic airway inflammation in an animal model. Epithelial SERPINB10 mRNA and protein expression were markedly increased in subjects with asthma (n = 60) compared with healthy controls (n = 25). Epithelial SERPINB10 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and three parameters reflecting airway eosinophilia including the percentage of sputum eosinophils, the number of eosinophils in bronchial submucosa, and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide in subjects with asthma. Moreover, epithelial SERPINB10 expression was strongly correlated with the epithelial gene signature (CLCA1, POSTN, and SERPINB2) for type 2 status. In normal human bronchial epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface, knockdown of SERPINB10 suppressed IL-13-stimulated periostin (encoded by POSTN) and CCL26 (eotaxin-3) expression by inhibiting the activation of p38 MAPK. Epithelial CCL26 mRNA levels were correlated with SERPINB10 expression in subjects with asthma. Airway knockdown of Serpinb10 alleviated AHR, airway eosinophilia and the expression of periostin and Ccl26 in a murine model of allergic airway disease. Taken together, epithelial SERPINB10 is a novel marker for airway eosinophilia in asthma. Epithelial SERPINB10 contributes to allergic airway eosinophilic inflammation, at least in part, by regulating the expression of periostin and CCL26.},

  abstract = {The lower airways of asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients can be colonized by bacteria, mainly Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, the role of lower airway bacteria in stable and exacerbated COPD has not been well defined. To determine the importance of lower airway bacterial infection in COPD we studied 40 outpatients with stable COPD (Group A: age 61.1 +/- 9.9 yr; [mean +/- SD]; FEV1/FVC 51.7 +/- 12.5) and 29 outpatients with exacerbated COPD (Group B: age 63.4, SD 9.0 yr; FEV1/FVC 52.0, SD 9.6), using the protected specimen brush (PSB) for microbiology sampling. Group A consisted of outpatients with stable COPD having normal or near-normal chest X-rays, with clinical indications for performing fiber-bronchoscopy (pulmonary nodule, remote hemoptysis); Group B consisted of patients with exacerbated COPD who voluntarily accepted lower airway microbiology sampling. To avoid contamination by upper airway flora the PSB was used for bacterial sampling in all the cases and concentrations {$>$} or = 1,000 colony-forming units/milliliter (CFU/ml) were considered positive. Results were as follows: Group A: Lung function data in outpatients with stable COPD were lower than the reference values for this population (FVC 2.97 +/- 1.02 L, FVC\% 71.4 +/- 22.4, FEV1 1.59 +/- 0.79 L, FEV1\% 51.2 +/- 23.0). Positive PSB cultures were obtained in 10 of 40 cases (25\%), mainly of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae. Two of 40 cases had positive cultures at concentrations {$>$} or = 10,000 CFU/ml (5.0\%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This is challenging, however, when relevant differences are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1α and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis of genomic profiling experiments.},

Multiple library preparation protocols currently exist. We have performed 22 whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing experiments on snap frozen human samples, and extensively benchmarked common library preparation protocols for whole-genome DNA methylation sequencing, including three traditional bisulfite-based protocols and a new enzyme-based protocol. In addition, different input DNA quantities were compared for two kits compatible with a reduced starting quantity. In addition, we also present bioinformatic analysis pipelines for sequencing data from each of these library types.                                         Results               An assortment of metrics were collected for each kit, including raw read statistics, library quality and uniformity metrics, cytosine retention, and CpG beta value consistency between technical replicates. Overall, the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq and Swift Accel-NGS Methyl-Seq kits performed quantitatively better than the other two protocols. In addition, the NEB and Swift kits performed well at low-input amounts, validating their utility in applications where DNA is the limiting factor.

  abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells were so named for their uniqueness in killing certain tumor and virusinfected cells without prior sensitization. Their functions are modulated in vivo by several soluble immune mediators; interleukin-15 (IL-15) being the most potent among them in enabling NK cell homeostasis, maturation, and activation. During microbial infections, NK cells stimulated with IL-15 display enhanced cytokine responses. This priming effect has previously been shown with respect to increased IFN-γ production in NK cells upon IL12 and IL-15/IL-2 co-stimulation. In this study, we explored if this effect of IL-15 priming can be extended to various other cytokines and observed enhanced NK cell responses to stimulation with IL-4, IL-21, IFN-α, and IL-2 in addition to IL-12. Notably, we also observed elevated IFN-γ production in primed NK cells upon stimulation through the Ly49H activation receptor. Currently, the fundamental processes required for priming and whether these signaling pathways work collaboratively or independently for NK cell functions are poorly understood. To identify the key signaling events for NK cell priming, we examined IL-15 effects on NK cells in which the pathways emanating from IL-15 receptor activation were blocked with specific inhibitors. Our results demonstrate that the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway is critical for cytokine responses in IL-15 primed NK cells. Furthermore, this pathway is also implicated in a broad range of IL-15-induced NK cell effector functions such as proliferation and cytotoxicity. Likewise, NK cells from mice treated with rapamycin to block the mTOR pathway displayed defects in proliferation, and IFN-γ and granzyme B productions resulting in elevated viral burdens upon murine cytomegalovirus infection. Taken together, our data demonstrate the requirement of PI3K–mTOR pathway for enhanced NK cell functions by IL-15, thereby coupling the metabolic sensor mTOR to NK cell anti-viral responses.},

Our study aimed to determine whether rs7937 (RAB4B, EGLN2), a top genetic variant in 19q13.2 region identified in genome-wide association studies of COPD, is associated with differential DNA methylation in blood (N ¼ 1490) and gene expression in blood (N ¼ 721) and lungs (N ¼ 1087). We combined genetic and epigenetic data from the Rotterdam Study (RS) to perform the epigenome-wide association analysis of rs7937. Further, we used genetic and transcriptomic data from blood (RS) and from lung tissue (Lung expression quantitative trait loci mapping study), to perform the transcriptome-wide association study of rs7937. Rs7937 was significantly (FDR {$<$} 0.05) and consistently associated with differential DNA methylation in blood at 4 CpG sites in cis, independent of smoking. One methylation site (cg11298343-EGLN2) was also associated with COPD (P ¼ 0.001). Additionally, rs7937 was associated with gene expression levels in blood in cis (EGLN2), 42\% mediated through cg11298343, and in lung tissue, in cis and trans (NUMBL, EGLN2, DNMT3A, LOC101929709 and PAK2). Our results suggest that changes of DNA methylation and gene expression may be intermediate steps between genetic variants and COPD, but further causal studies in lung tissue should confirm this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Background               . Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent, extracellular matrix protein. MGP is a calcification inhibitor of arteries and cartilage. However MGP is synthesized in many tissues and is especially enriched in embryonic tissues and in cancer cells. The presence of MGP in those instances does not correlate well with the calcification inhibitory role. This study explores a potential mechanism for MGP to bind to matrix proteins and alter cell matrix interactions.               Methods               . To determine whether MGP influences cell behavior through interaction with fibronectin, we studied MGP binding to fibronectin, the effect of MGP on fibronectin mediated cell attachment and spreading and immunolocalized MGP and fibronectin.               Results               . First, MGP binds to fibronectin. The binding site for MGP is in a specific fibronectin fragment, called III1-C or anastellin. The binding site for fibronectin is in a MGP C-terminal peptide comprising amino acids 61–77. Second, MGP enhances cell attachment and cell spreading on fibronectin. MGP alone does not promote cell adhesion. Third, MGP is present in fibronectin-rich regions of tissue sections.               Conclusions               . MGP binds to fibronectin. The presence of MGP increased cell-fibronectin interactions.},

While these drafts and the updates that followed effectively covered the euchromatic fraction of the genome, the heterochromatin and many other complex regions were left unfinished or erroneous. Addressing this remaining 8\% of the genome, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium has finished the first truly complete 3.055 billion base pair (bp) sequence of a human genome, representing the largest improvement to the human reference genome since its initial release. The new T2T-CHM13 reference includes gapless assemblies for all 22 autosomes plus Chromosome X, corrects numerous errors, and introduces nearly 200 million bp of novel sequence containing 2,226 paralogous gene copies, 115 of which are predicted to be protein coding. The newly completed regions include all centromeric satellite arrays and the short arms of all five acrocentric chromosomes, unlocking these complex regions of the genome to variational and functional studies for the first time.},

WNT16 is a crucial physiological regulator of bone mass and fracture susceptibility, and we hypothesize that disturbed WNT16 activity might be involved in the deleterious effects of GC in bone. Twelve-week-old female Obl-Wnt16 mice (WNT16 expression driven by the rat procollagen type I α1 promoter) and wild-type (WT) littermates were treated with prednisolone (7.6 mg·kg               −1               ·day               −1               ) or vehicle for 4 wk. We first observed that GC treatment decreased the Wnt16 mRNA levels in bone of female mice (−56.4\,±\,6.1\% compared with vehicle, P {$<$} 0.001). We next evaluated if WNT16 overexpression protects against GC-induced bone loss. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry analyses revealed that GC treatment decreased total body bone mineral density in WT mice (−3.9\,±\,1.2\%, P = 0.028) but not in Obl-Wnt16 mice (+1.3\,±\,1.4\%, nonsignificant). Microcomputed tomography analyses showed that GC treatment decreased trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of the femur in WT mice ( P = 0.019) but not in Obl-Wnt16 mice. Serum levels of the bone formation marker procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide were substantially reduced by GC treatment in WT mice (−50.3\,±\,7.0\%, P = 0.008) but not in Obl-Wnt16 mice (−3.8\,±\,21.2\%, nonsignificant). However, the cortical bone thickness in femur was reduced by GC treatment in both WT mice and Obl-Wnt16 mice. In conclusion, GC treatment decreases Wnt16 mRNA levels in bone and WNT16 overexpression partly protects against GC-induced bone loss.},

The early stages of such an outbreak can be modeled by a graph whose edges encode these interactions between individuals, the vertices. This article attempts to account for the case when each individual entails in different kinds of interactions which have therefore different probabilities of transmitting the disease. The majority of these results can be also stated in the language of percolation theory. The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some results which were previously known in the case when each individual has only one kind of interactions. (2) Find an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number R0 which depends only on the probabilities of transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments of the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the R0 of a model disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are adjusted to several different countries. In this setting, we shall also compute the probability that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic. In all cases we find such probability to be very low if no interventions are put in place.},

We studied age-related mRNA and miRNA expression changes and their interactions in normal airways. RNA and small RNA sequencing was performed on bronchial biopsies of 86 healthy individuals (age: 18–73) to determine age-related expression changes. Per age-related miRNA we determined the enrichment of age-related predicted targets and their correlation. We identified 285 age-related genes and 27 age-related miRNAs. Pathway enrichment showed that genes higher expressed with age were involved in synapse-related processes. Genes lower expressed with age were involved in cell cycle regulation, the immune system and DNA damage/repair. MiR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p and miR-142-5p were lower expressed with increasing age and we found a significant enrichment for predicted targets of these miRNAs among genes that were higher expressed with age. the expression levels of the enriched predicted targets RIMS2 and IGSF1 were negatively correlated with both miR-146a-5p and miR146b-5p. RIMS2 was present in the enriched process, i.e. positive regulation of synaptic transmission. In conclusion, genes decreased with ageing are involved in several of the ageing hallmarks. Genes higher expressed with ageing were involved in synapse-related processes, of which RIMS2 is potentially regulated by two age-related miRNAs.},

  abstract = {Cigarette smoking causes lung inflammation and tissue damage. Lung fibroblasts play a major role in tissue repair. Previous studies have reported smoking-associated changes in fibroblast responses and methylation patterns. Our aim was to identify the effect of current smoking on miRNA expression in primary lung fibroblasts. Small RNA sequencing was performed on lung fibroblasts from nine current and six ex-smokers with normal lung function. MiR-335-5p and miR-335-3p were significantly downregulated in lung fibroblasts from current compared to ex-smokers (false discovery rate (FDR) {$<$}0.05). Differential miR-335-5p expression was validated with RT-qPCR (p-value = 0.01). The results were validated in lung tissue from current and ex-smokers and in bronchial biopsies from non-diseased smokers and never-smokers (p-value {$<$}0.05). The methylation pattern of the miR-335 host gene, determined by methylation-specific qPCR, did not differ between current and ex-smokers. To obtain insights into the genes regulated by miR-335-5p in fibroblasts, we overlapped all proven miR-335-5p targets with our previously published miRNA targetome data in lung fibroblasts. This revealed Rb1, CARF, and SGK3 as likely targets of miR-335-5p in lung fibroblasts. Our study indicates that miR-335-5p downregulation due to current smoking may affect its function in lung fibroblasts by targeting Rb1, CARF and SGK3.},

  abstract = {The accurate quantification of changes in the abundance of proteins is one of the main applications of proteomics. The maintenance of accuracy can be affected by bias and error that can occur at many points in the experimental process, and normalization strategies are crucial to attempt to overcome this bias and return the sample to its regular biological condition, or normal state. Much work has been published on performing normalization on data post-acquisition with many algorithms and statistical processes available. However, there are many other sources of bias that can occur during experimental design and sample handling that are currently unaddressed. This article aims to cast light on the potential sources of bias and where normalization could be applied to return the sample to its normal state. Throughout we suggest solutions where possible but, in some cases, solutions are not available. Thus, we see this article as a starting point for discussion of the definition of and the issues surrounding the concept of normalization as it applies to the proteomic analysis of biological samples. Specifically, we discuss a wide range of different normalization techniques that can occur at each stage of the sample preparation and analysis process.},

Objectives: To comprehensively evaluate the effects of rare SERPINA1 variants on lung function and emphysema phenotypes in subjects with significant tobacco smoke exposure using deep gene resequencing and alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations. Methods: DNA samples from 1,693 non-Hispanic white individuals, 385 African Americans, and 90 Hispanics with {$>$}20 pack-years smoking were resequenced for the identification of rare variants (allele frequency , 0.05) in 16.9 kB of SERPINA1. Measurements and Main Results: White PI Z heterozygotes confirmed by sequencing (MZ; n = 74) had lower postbronchodilator FEV1 (P = 0.007), FEV1/FVC (P = 0.003), and greater computed tomography–based emphysema (P = 0.02) compared with 1,411 white individuals without PI Z, S, or additional rare variants denoted as VR.PIZ–containing compound heterozygotes (ZS/ZVR; n = 7) had lower FEV1/FVC (P = 0.02) and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase (P = 0.009). Nineteen white heterozygotes for five non-S/Z coding variants associated with lower alpha-1 antitrypsin had greater computed tomography–based emphysema compared with those without rare variants. In African Americans, a 59 untranslated region insertion (rs568223361) was associated with lower alpha-1 antitrypsin and functional small airway disease (P = 0.007). Conclusions: In this integrative deep sequencing study of SERPINA1 with alpha-1 antitrypsin concentrations in a heavy smoker and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cohort, we confirmed the effects of PI Z heterozygote and compound heterozygote genotypes. We demonstrate the cumulative effects of multiple SERPINA1 variants on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, lung function, and emphysema, thus significantly increasing the frequency of SERPINA1 variation associated with respiratory disease in at-risk smokers.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease and is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Chronic inflammation and repair processes in the small airways are characteristic of COPD. Despite extensive efforts from researchers and industry, there is still no cure for COPD, hence an urgent need for new therapeutic alternatives. MicroRNAs are such an option; they are small noncoding RNAs involved in gene regulation. Their importance has been shown with respect to maintaining the balance between health and disease. Although previous reviews have discussed the expression of microRNAs related to lung disease, a detailed discussion regarding the function of differential miRNA expression in the pathogenesis of COPD is lacking.             In this review we link the expression of microRNAs to different features of COPD and explain their importance in the pathogenesis of this disease. We further discuss their potential to contribute to the development of future therapeutic strategies.},

Here we characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of self-reactive CD8               +               T cells in a mouse model of protracted central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity and compare it to populations of CNS-resident memory CD8               +               T cells emerging from acute viral infection. We find that autoimmune CD8               +               T cells persisting at sites of self-antigen exhibit characteristic transcriptional regulation together with distinct epigenetic remodeling. This self-reactive CD8               +               T cell fate depends on the transcriptional regulation by the DNA-binding HMG-box protein TOX which remodels more than 400 genomic regions including loci such as               Tcf7               , which is central to stemness of CD8               +               T cells. Continuous exposure to CNS self-antigen sustains TOX levels in self-reactive CD8               +               T cells, whereas genetic ablation of TOX in CD8               +               T cells results in shortened persistence of self-reactive CD8               +               T cells in the inflamed CNS.

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent airway disease characterized by an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Cigarette smoking remains a major risk factor in COPD development. Accumulating evidence suggests that apoptosis, a regulated form of cell death, may play an important role in COPD pathogenesis. Increased numbers of apoptotic cells can be detected in lung tissue and airwaysof human subjects with COPD, relative to normal lungs or those from smokerswithout COPD. Alveolar wall destruction associated with emphysema development, may involve increased apoptosis of alveolar structural cells. Several intervention-induced apoptotic models (e.g., cigarette smoke, vascular-endothelial growth factor inhibition, and interferon-γ) cause emphysematous changes in vitro and in vivo. Increased apoptosis in COPD can also imply defects in the normal physiological clearance of apoptotic cells. Additional factors that relate to perpetuation of the pathogenesis of COPD, including protease/antiprotease imbalance, inflammation and oxidative stress, may mutually promote apoptosis or contribute to impaired clearance of apoptotic cells. Given that cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD, identification of the pathways of cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis may further the understanding of COPD pathogenesis. However, apoptosis rate is not diminished after cessation of cigarette smoking, indicating that other mechanisms perpetuate apoptosis in COPD. Therefore, understanding functional relationships between apoptosis and protease/antiprotease imbalance, inflammation, oxidative stress and other factors potentially involved in COPD pathogenesis may uncover crucial therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is a key layer of epigenetic regulation. The deposition of methylation marks relies on the catalytic activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and their active removal relies on the activity of ten–eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. Paradoxically, in important biological contexts these antagonistic factors are co-expressed and target overlapping genomic regions. The ensuing cyclic biochemistry of cytosine modifications gives rise to a continuous, out-of-thermal equilibrium transition through different methylation states. But what is the purpose of this intriguing turnover of DNA methylation? Recent evidence demonstrates that methylation turnover is enriched at gene distal regulatory elements, including enhancers, and can give rise to large-scale oscillatory dynamics. We discuss this phenomenon and propose that DNA methylation turnover might facilitate key lineage decisions.},

Specifically, this section addresses the interpretation of spirometry, bronchodilator response, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity ( D L,CO) and lung volumes. The sources of variation in lung function testing and technical aspects of spirometry, lung volume measurements and D L,CO measurement have been considered in other documents published in this series of Task Force reports 1–4 and in the American Thoracic Society (ATS) interpretative strategies document 5. An interpretation begins with a review and comment on test quality. Tests that are less than optimal may still contain useful information, but interpreters should identify the problems and the direction and magnitude of the potential errors. Omitting the quality review and relying only on numerical results for clinical decision making is a common mistake, which is more easily made by those who are dependent upon computer interpretations. Once quality has been assured, the next steps involve a series of comparisons 6 that include comparisons of test results with reference values based on healthy subjects 5, comparisons with known disease or abnormal physiological patterns ( i.e. obstruction and restriction), and comparisons with self, a rather formal term for evaluating change in an individual patient. A final step in the lung function report is to answer the clinical question that prompted the test.

Although compositions of cell type and ratios can be obtained by single-cell sequencing, single-cell sequencing is currently expensive and cannot be applied in clinical studies involving a large number of subjects. Therefore, it is useful to apply the bulk RNA-Seq dataset and the single-cell RNA dataset to deconvolute and obtain the cell type composition in the tissue.                                         Results               By analyzing the existing cell population prediction methods, we found that most of the existing methods need the cell-type-specific gene expression profile as the input of the signature matrix. However, in real applications, it is not always possible to find an available signature matrix. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel method, named DCap, to predict cell abundance. DCap is a deconvolution method based on non-negative least squares. DCap considers the weight resulting from measurement noise of bulk RNA-seq and calculation error of single-cell RNA-seq data, during the calculation process of non-negative least squares and performs the weighted iterative calculation based on least squares. By weighting the bulk tissue gene expression matrix and single-cell gene expression matrix, DCap minimizes the measurement error of bulk RNA-Seq and also reduces errors resulting from differences in the number of expressed genes in the same type of cells in different samples. Evaluation test shows that DCap performs better in cell type abundance prediction than existing methods.                                         Conclusion               DCap solves the deconvolution problem using weighted non-negative least squares to predict cell type abundance in tissues. DCap has better prediction results and does not need to prepare a signature matrix that gives the cell-type-specific gene expression profile in advance. By using DCap, we can better study the changes in cell proportion in diseased tissues and provide more information on the follow-up treatment of diseases.},

  abstract = {Significance             MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression and have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes. Using small RNA sequencing, we identified microRNA 4423 (miR-4423) as a primate-specific microRNA whose expression is largely restricted to airway epithelium and which functions as a regulator of airway epithelium differentiation and a repressor of lung carcinogenesis. Understanding miR-4423’s role in airway development may provide insights into primate-specific aspects of airway biology and the evolution of primate-specific tumor suppressors. Moreover, this study opens the possibility that microRNAs might be useful for the early detection of lung cancer in the proximal airway and that miR-4423 mimetics might also be used as therapeutic agents to specifically target lung cancer.           ,              Smoking is a significant risk factor for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although microRNAs are regulators of many airway gene-expression changes induced by smoking, their role in modulating changes associated with lung cancer in these cells remains unknown. Here, we use next-generation sequencing of small RNAs in the airway to identify microRNA 4423 (miR-4423) as a primate-specific microRNA associated with lung cancer and expressed primarily in mucociliary epithelium. The endogenous expression of miR-4423 increases as bronchial epithelial cells undergo differentiation into mucociliary epithelium in vitro, and its overexpression during this process causes an increase in the number of ciliated cells. Furthermore, expression of miR-4423 is reduced in most lung tumors and in cytologically normal epithelium of the mainstem bronchus of smokers with lung cancer. In addition, ectopic expression of miR-4423 in a subset of lung cancer cell lines reduces their anchorage-independent growth and significantly decreases the size of the tumors formed in a mouse xenograft model. Consistent with these phenotypes, overexpression of miR-4423 induces a differentiated-like pattern of airway epithelium gene expression and reverses the expression of many genes that are altered in lung cancer. Together, our results indicate that miR-4423 is a regulator of airway epithelium differentiation and that the abrogation of its function contributes to lung carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: The identification and characterisation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between phenotypes in the human genome is of prime interest in epigenetics. We present a novel method, DMRcate,thatfits replicated methylation measurements from the Illumina HM450K BeadChip (or 450K array) spatially across the genome using a Gaussian kernel. DMRcate identifies and ranks the most differentially methylated regions across the genome based on tunable kernel smoothing of the differential methylation (DM) signal. The method is agnostic to both genomic annotation and local change in the direction of the DM signal, removes the bias incurred from irregularly spaced methylation sites, and assigns significance to each DMR called via comparison to a null model. Results: We show that, for both simulated and real data, the predictive performance of DMRcate is superior to those of Bumphunter and Probe Lasso, and commensurate with that of comb-p. For the real data, we validate all array-derived DMRs from the candidate methods on a suite of DMRs derived from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing called from the same DNA samples, using two separate phenotype comparisons. Conclusions: The agglomeration of genomically localised individual methylation sites into discrete DMRs is currently best served by a combination of DM-signal smoothing and subsequent threshold specification. The findings also suggest the design of the 450K array shows preference for CpG sites that are more likely to be differentially methylated, but its overall coverage does not adequately reflect the depth and complexity of methylation signatures afforded by sequencing. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called DMRcate, downloadable from Bioconductor and compatible with existing preprocessing packages, which allows others to apply the same DMR-finding method on 450K array data.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               As the most stable and experimentally accessible epigenetic mark, DNA methylation is of great interest to the research community. The landscape of DNA methylation across tissues, through development and in disease pathogenesis is not yet well characterized. Thus there is a need for rapid and cost effective methods for assessing genome-wide levels of DNA methylation. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a very useful addition to the available methods for DNA methylation analysis but its complex design, incorporating two different assay methods, requires careful consideration. Accordingly, several normalization schemes have been published. We have taken advantage of known DNA methylation patterns associated with genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), in addition to the performance of SNP genotyping assays present on the array, to derive three independent metrics which we use to test alternative schemes of correction and normalization. These metrics also have potential utility as quality scores for datasets.                                         Results                                The standard index of DNA methylation at any specific CpG site is                 β                 =                 M                 /(                 M                 +                 U                 + 100) where M and U are methylated and unmethylated signal intensities, respectively. Betas (                 β                 s) calculated from raw signal intensities (the default GenomeStudio behavior) perform well, but using 11 methylomic datasets we demonstrate that quantile normalization methods produce marked improvement, even in highly consistent data, by all three metrics. The commonly used procedure of normalizing betas is inferior to the separate normalization of M and U, and it is also advantageous to normalize Type I and Type II assays separately. More elaborate manipulation of quantiles proves to be counterproductive.                                                        Conclusions               Careful selection of preprocessing steps can minimize variance and thus improve statistical power, especially for the detection of the small absolute DNA methylation changes likely associated with complex disease phenotypes. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called wateRmelon, downloadable from bioConductor, compatible with the existing methylumi, minfi and IMA packages, that allows others to utilize the same normalization methods and data quality tests on 450K data.},

  abstract = {We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii)               in silico               prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested               in vitro               on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3~h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that constitute an essential and evolutionarily conserved mechanism for post-transcriptional gene regulation. Multiple miRNAs have been described to play key roles in T lymphocyte development, differentiation and function. In this review we highlight the current literature regarding the differential expression of miRNAs in various models of mouse and human T cell biology and emphasize mechanistic understandings of miRNA regulation of thymocyte development, T cell activation, and differentiation into effector and memory subsets. We describe the participation of miRNAs in complex regulatory circuits shaping T cell proteomes in a context-dependent manner. It is striking that some miRNAs regulate multiple processes, while others only appear in limited functional contexts. It is also evident that the expression and function of specific miRNAs can differ between mouse and human systems. Ultimately, it is not always correct to simplify the complex events of T cell biology into a model driven by only one or two master regulator miRNAs. In reality, T cell activation and differentiation involves the expression of multiple miRNAs with many mRNA targets and thus, the true extent of miRNA regulation of T cell biology is likely far more vast than currently appreciated.},

  abstract = {Airway and lung tissue remodeling and fibrosis play an important role in the development of symptoms associated with lung function loss in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In the past decades, much attention has been paid to the inflammatory cellular process involved in airway remodeling in these two diseases. However, it is increasingly clear that resident cells contribute to airway and lung tissue remodeling and to associated fibrosis as well. This article deals with some new aspects and discusses the role of vasculature and vascular endothelial growth factor in the development of airway obstruction and airway wall fibrosis in asthma and COPD. Moreover, it addresses the extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover as present in both asthma and COPD. All components of lung ECM (collagen, elastic fibers, proteoglycans) have been shown to be potentially altered in these two diseases. Finally, the interaction between transforming growth factor (TGF), Smad signaling, and TGF in the ECM turnover will be discussed. We propose that ECM damage and repair contribute to airway and lung tissue pathology and that the vasculature may enhance this process. The localization of this process is dependent on the etiology of the disease (i.e., allergen-driven in asthma and smoke-driven in COPD) and the local environment in which the pathologic process takes place.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: The aim of the Task Force was to derive continuous prediction equations and their lower limits of normal for spirometric indices, which are applicable globally. Over 160,000 data points from 72 centres in 33 countries were shared with the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative. Eliminating data that could not be used (mostly missing ethnic group, some outliers) left 97,759 records of healthy nonsmokers (55.3\% females) aged 2.5–95 yrs. Lung function data were collated and prediction equations derived using the LMS method, which allows simultaneous modelling of the mean (mu), the coefficient of variation (sigma) and skewness (lambda) of a distribution family. After discarding 23,572 records, mostly because they could not be combined with other ethnic or geographic groups, reference equations were derived for healthy individuals aged 3–95 yrs for Caucasians (n557,395), African–Americans (n53,545), and North (n54,992) and South East Asians (n58,255). Forced expiratory value in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) between ethnic groups differed proportionally from that in Caucasians, such that FEV1/FVC remained virtually independent of ethnic group. For individuals not represented by these four groups, or of mixed ethnic origins, a composite equation taken as the average of the above equations is provided to facilitate interpretation until a more appropriate solution is developed. Spirometric prediction equations for the 3–95-age range are now available that include appropriate age-dependent lower limits of normal. They can be applied globally to different ethnic groups. Additional data from the Indian subcontinent and Arabic, Polynesian and Latin American countries, as well as Africa will further improve these equations in the future.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is responsible for early mortality, high death rates and significant cost to health systems. The projection for 2020 indicates that COPD will be the third leading cause of death worldwide (from sixth in 1990) and fifth leading cause of years lost through early mortality or handicap (disability-adjusted life years) (12th in 1990). Active smoking remains the main risk factor, but other factors are becoming better known, such as occupational factors, infections and the role of air pollution. Prevalence of COPD varies according to country, age and sex. This disease is also associated with significant comorbidities. COPD is a disorder that includes various phenotypes, the continuum of which remains under debate. The major challenge in the coming years will be to prevent onset of smoking along with early detection of the disease in the general population.},

  abstract = {Neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS) is a defining feature of organismal aging that is influenced by peripheral tissues. Clinical observations indicate that skeletal muscle influences CNS aging, but the underlying muscle-to-brain signaling remains unexplored. In Drosophila, we find that moderate perturbation of the proteasome in skeletal muscle induces compensatory preservation of CNS proteostasis during aging. Such long-range stress signaling depends on muscle-secreted Amyrel amylase. Mimicking stress-induced Amyrel upregulation in muscle reduces age-related accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the brain and retina via chaperones. Preservation of proteostasis stems from the disaccharide maltose, which is produced via Amyrel amylase activity. Correspondingly, RNAi for SLC45 maltose transporters reduces expression of Amyrel-induced chaperones and worsens brain proteostasis during aging. Moreover, maltose preserves proteostasis and neuronal activity in human brain organoids challenged by thermal stress. Thus, proteasome stress in skeletal muscle hinders retinal and brain aging by mounting an adaptive response via amylase/maltose.},

These progenitor cells are differentially pre-programmed by their tissue microenvironment but, when cultured and stimulated in~vitro, these cells — commonly referred to as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) — exhibit a marked plasticity to differentiate into many different cell lineages. Loss-of- function studies in~vitro and in~vivo have uncovered the involvement of specific signalling pathways and key transcriptional regulators that work in a sequential and coordinated fashion to activate lineage-selective gene programmes. Recent advances in omics and single-cell technologies have made it possible to obtain system-wide insights into the gene regulatory networks that drive lineage determination and cell differentiation. These insights have important implications for the understanding of cell differentiation, the contribution of stromal cells to human disease and for the development of~cell- based therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sequencing technologies have changed not only our approaches to classical genetics, but also the field of epigenetics. Specific methods allow scientists to identify novel genome-wide epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation down to single-nucleotide resolution. DNA methylation is the most researched epigenetic mark involved in various processes in the human cell, including gene regulation and development of diseases, such as cancer. Increasing numbers of DNA methylation sequencing datasets from human genome are produced using various platforms—from methylated DNA precipitation to the whole genome bisulfite sequencing. Many of those datasets are fully accessible for repeated analyses. Sequencing experiments have become routine in laboratories around the world, while analysis of outcoming data is still a challenge among the majority of scientists, since in many cases it requires advanced computational skills. Even though various tools are being created and published, guidelines for their selection are often not clear, especially to non-bioinformaticians with limited experience in computational analyses. Separate tools are often used for individual steps in the analysis, and these can be challenging to manage and integrate. However, in some instances, tools are combined into pipelines that are capable to complete all the essential steps to achieve the result. In the case of DNA methylation sequencing analysis, the goal of such pipeline is to map sequencing reads, calculate methylation levels, and distinguish differentially methylated positions and/or regions. The objective of this review is to describe basic principles and steps in the analysis of DNA methylation sequencing data that in particular have been used for mammalian genomes, and more importantly to present and discuss the most pronounced computational pipelines that can be used to analyze such data. We aim to provide a good starting point for scientists with limited experience in computational analyses of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation data, and recommend a few tools that are powerful, but still easy enough to use for their own data analysis.},

Besides standard multiple testing corrections, a new improved method for estimating the true effect of multiple testing over complex structures like GO has been introduced. Interpreting ranked gene lists is supported from the same interface with very efficient algorithms. Such ordered lists may arise when studying the most significantly affected genes from high-throughput data or genes co-expressed with the query gene. Other important aspects of practical data analysis are supported by modules tightly integrated with g:Profiler. These are: g:Convert for converting between different database identifiers; g:Orth for finding orthologous genes from other species; and g:Sorter for searching a large body of public gene expression data for co-expression. g:Profiler supports 31 different species, and underlying data is updated regularly from sources like the Ensembl database.

  abstract = {Study objective: To determine the effectiveness of treatment with corticosteroids in patients with COPD. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effect of a 2-year treatment with corticosteroids on clin¬ ical symptoms and the decline oflung function in 58 nonallergic patients with COPD. Subjects were treated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel way with inhaled budesonide (bud), 1,600 ug/d; inhaled budesonide, 1,600 ug/d, plus oral prednisolone, 5 mg/d (bud+pred); or placebo (plac). Clinical assessment (history, physical examination, and spirometry) was carried out every 2 months. The rate of decline in FEVi was assessed by calculating individual regression co¬ efficients from linear regression of FEVi on time for each subject. Results: Eleven patients dropped out. The number of withdrawals due to pulmonary problems was significantly higher in the plac group (n=5 out of 18) than in the actively treated groups (n=2 out of 40). Treatment with corticosteroids significantly reduced pulmonary symptoms. Median decline of FEVi was 60 mL/yr in the plac group, 40 mL/yr in the bud+pred group, and 30 mL/yr in the bud group. Variation was large and differences were not statistically significant. No treatment effect was found on frequency or duration ofexacerbations, possiblybecause ofthe high number ofwithdrawals due to pulmonary deterioration in the plac group. Treatment with a combination ofinhaled plus oral corticosteroids was not more effective than inhaled corticosteroids alone. Morning plasma cortisol levels remained within the normal range in all three groups. Conclusions: Our study shows beneficial effects of long-term daily treatment with inhaled cortico¬ steroids in patients with COPD with regard to symptoms and drop out due to pulmonary problems. Lung function decline tends to decrease during treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. The observed effects are limited but warrant further studies on the effectiveness of corticosteroids in larger numbers of patients with CO},

  abstract = {To derive a global perspective on the transcription of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mammals, we annotated the genomic position and context of this class of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in the human and mouse genomes. Of the 232 known mammalian miRNAs, we found that 161 overlap with 123 defined transcription units (TUs). We identified miRNAs within introns of 90 protein-coding genes with a broad spectrum of molecular functions, and in both introns and exons of 66 mRNA-like noncoding RNAs (mlncRNAs). In addition, novel families of miRNAs based on host gene identity were identified. The transcription patterns of all miRNA host genes were curated from a variety of sources illustrating spatial, temporal, and physiological regulation of miRNA expression. These findings strongly suggest that miRNAs are transcribed in parallel with their host transcripts, and that the two different transcription classes of miRNAs (`exonic' and `intronic') identified here may require slightly different mechanisms of biogenesis.},

We aimed to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed between asthma patients and healthy controls, and explore their association with clinical and inflammatory parameters of asthma.                                         Methods               Differentially expressed miRNAs were determined by small RNA sequencing on bronchial biopsies of 79 asthma patients and 82 healthy controls using linear regression models. Differentially expressed miRNAs were associated with clinical and inflammatory asthma features. Potential miRNA–mRNA interactions were analysed using mRNA data available from the same bronchial biopsies, and enrichment of pathways was identified with Enrichr and g:Profiler.                                         Results               In total, 78 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in bronchial biopsies of asthma patients compared with controls, of which 60 remained differentially expressed after controlling for smoking and inhaled corticosteroid treatment. We identified several asthma-associated miRNAs, including miR-125b-5p and miR-223-3p, based on a significant association with multiple clinical and inflammatory asthma features and their negative correlation with genes associated with the presence of asthma. The most enriched biological pathway(s) affected by miR-125b-5p and miR-223-3p were inflammatory response and cilium assembly/organisation. Of interest, we identified that lower expression of miR-26a-5p was linked to more severe eosinophilic inflammation as measured in blood, sputum as well as bronchial biopsies.                                         Conclusion               Collectively, we identified miR-125b-5p, miR-223-3p and miR-26a-5p as potential regulators that could contribute to the pathogenesis of asthma.},

The apparent expression of more than one type of oligosaccharide core structure in mucins isolated from pathological material may reflect either inherent limitations in analysis, disease-related alterations in parameters affecting glycosylation and post-translational modifications (e.g., nucleotide-sugar concentrations, expression of specific glycosyltransferases, rates of transport through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) or the activation of mucin protein genes that are more highly expressed in disease states with different glycosylation patterns. Recent studies have revealed the existence of a family of at least four human mucin proteins; MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, each of which contains a variable number of tandem repeats that differ in sequence and size. Full-length sequences of cDNA clones encoding human mucin proteins are currently available only for MUC1 which, in contrast to most airway and intestinal mucins, is membrane associated and not secreted. Current information on mucin oligosaccharides and proteins is reviewed herein. More detailed knowledge of the protein and oligosaccharide structures of mucins will be important in identifying specific role(s) in health and disease, i.e., in the physiological functions of mucus.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background and Objective: The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend using a combination of spirometry, symptoms and exacerbation history to classify patients into 4 categories (A, B, C, D) to guide treatment decisions along with a stepwise increase in therapy. Our objectives were to identify the GOLD stage of patients in respiratory outpatient clinics and assess how treatment compares to guideline recommendations. Methods: This was a point prevalence study using a convenience sample of 500 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from a single tertiary care outpatient respiratory clinic. Results: Patients’ GOLD classification was determined based on symptoms (modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] dyspnea scale, COPD Assessment Test [CAT]), spirometry and self-reported exacerbation history. A total of 8.2\% of patients were in the GOLD group A, 28.3\% in group B, 4.2\% in group C and 59.2\% in group D. Conclusions: In this 500 patient point prevalence study we report a low proportion of patients in GOLD group C and a high level of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)/ long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and triple therapy use throughout all GOLD categories. Clinical Implications: The GOLD guidelines have attempted to provide direction to practitioners by grouping patients into 4 groups based on symptoms and exacerbations however, the low prevalence of GOLD group C may indicate that not all of these groupings are clinically relevant. Future research is needed to better identify clinically relevant phenotypes that predict benefit from ICS and methods to promote guideline concordant management in COPD.},

We generated a unique dataset of 81,643 APCs, including monocytes and rare dendritic cell (DC) subsets. We uncovered multi-process defects in antiviral immune defence in specific APCs from patients with severe disease: (1) increased pro-apoptotic pathways in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs, key effectors of antiviral immunity), (2) a decrease of the innate sensors TLR9 and DHX36 in pDCs and CLEC9a+ DCs, respectively, (3) downregulation of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes in monocyte subsets and (4) a decrease of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-related genes and MHC class II transactivator activity in cDC1c+ DCs, suggesting viral inhibition of antigen presentation. These novel mechanisms may explain patient aggravation and suggest strategies to restore the defective immune defence.},

In Colombia, screening for preneoplastic lesions (PNL) and the presence of H. pylori is not routinely performed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate OLGA-OLGIM staging and the interobserver agreement in gastritis and preneoplastic lesions in patients with gastroduodenal symptoms from Colombia. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 272 patients with gastroduodenal symptoms. Gastric biopsies were taken following the Updated Sydney System with the OLGA-OLGIM classification, and the results were evaluated by two pathologists. Chronic gastritis and PNL were reported in 76\% and 24\% of the patients, respectively. Furthermore, 25\% of the patients with PNL displayed gastric atrophy (GA) and 75\% intestinal metaplasia (IM). Agreement in the histopathological reading for IM was good, whereas for OLGA was variable, and for the H. pylori quantity was poor. OLGA-OLGIM stages 0-II were the most frequent (96\%), while stage III (4\%) and SC (4\%) were the least frequent. Age and coffee consumption were associated with a higher prevalence of PNL. This work determined that 4\% of the population is at high risk of developing SC and would benefit from follow-up studies. Reinforcement of training programs to improve the agreement in histopathology readings is required.},

  abstract = {In obese people, the presence of adipose tissue around the rib cage and abdomen and in the visceral cavity loads the chest wall and reduces functional residual capacity (FRC). The reduction in FRC and in expiratory reserve volume is detectable, even at a modest increase in weight. However, obesity has little direct effect on airway caliber. Spirometric variables decrease in proportion to lung volumes, but are rarely below the normal range, even in the extremely obese, while reductions in expiratory flows and increases in airway resistance are largely normalized by adjusting for lung volumes. Nevertheless, the reduction in FRC has consequences for other aspects of lung function. A low FRC increases the risk of both expiratory flow limitation and airway closure. Marked reductions in expiratory reserve volume may lead to abnormalities in ventilation distribution, with closure of airways in the dependent zones of the lung and ventilation perfusion inequalities. Greater airway closure during tidal breathing is associated with lower arterial oxygen saturation in some subjects, even though lung CO-diffusing capacity is normal or increased in the obese. Bronchoconstriction has the potential to enhance the effects of obesity on airway closure and thus on ventilation distribution. Thus obesity has effects on lung function that can reduce respiratory well-being, even in the absence of specific respiratory disease, and may also exaggerate the effects of existing airway disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease poses a major risk for public health, yet remarkably little is known about its detailed pathophysiology. Definition of COPD by non-reversible pulmonary obstruction revealing more about spatial orientation than about mechanisms of pathology may be a major reason for this. We conducted a controlled observational study allowing for simultaneous assessment of clinical and biological development in COPD. 16 healthy controls and 104 subjects with chronic bronchitis, with or without pulmonary obstruction at baseline, were investigated. Using both extent and change of bronchial obstruction as main scoring criteria for the analysis of gene expression in lung tissue. We identified 410 genes significantly associated with progression of COPD. 110 of these genes demonstrated a distinctive expression pattern, their functional annotations indicating a participation in the regulation of cellular coherence, membrane integrity, growth and differentiation as well as inflammation and fibroproliferative repair. The regulatory pattern indicates a sequentially unfolding pathology that centers on a two-step failure of surface integrity commencing with a loss of epithelial coherence as early as chronic bronchitis. Decline of regenerative repair starting in GOLD stage I then activates degradation of ECM hyaluronan causing structural failure of the bronchial wall only to be resolved by scar formation. While requiring independent confirmation, our findings provide the first tangible pathophysiological concept for COPD to be further exploited.},

  abstract = {The development of therapeutic approaches to treat lung disease requires an understanding of both the normal and disease physiology of the lung. Although traditional experimental approaches only address either organ or cellular physiology, the use of lung slice preparations provides a unique approach to investigate integrated physiology that links the cellular and organ responses. Living lung slices are robust and can be prepared from a variety of species, including humans, and they retain many aspects of the cellular and structural organization of the lung. Functional portions of intrapulmonary airways, arterioles and veins are present within the alveoli parenchyma. The dynamics of macroscopic changes of contraction and relaxation associated with the airways and vessels are readily observed with conventional low-magnification microscopy. The microscopic changes associated with cellular events, that determine the macroscopic responses, can be observed with confocal or two-photon microscopy. To investigate disease processes, lung slices can either be prepared from animal models of disease or animals exposed to disease invoking conditions. Alternatively, the lung slices themselves can be experimentally manipulated. Because of the ability to observe changes in cell physiology and how these responses manifest themselves at the level of the organ, lung slices have become a standard tool for the investigation of lung disease.},

We show that PI3Kγ controls thymocyte survival and activation of mature T cells but has no role in the development or function of B cells. PI3Kγ-deficient neutrophils exhibited severe defects in migration and respiratory burst in response to heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein)–coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and chemotactic agents. PI3Kγ links GPCR stimulation to the formation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and the activation of protein kinase B, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Thus, PI3Kγ regulates thymocyte development, T cell activation, neutrophil migration, and the oxidative burst.},

  abstract = {We have shown that smoking impacts bronchial airway gene expression and that heterogeneity in this response associates with smoking-related disease risk. In this study, we sought to determine whether microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in regulating the airway gene expression response to smoking. We examined whole-genome miRNA and mRNA expression in bronchial airway epithelium from current and never smokers (               n               = 20) and found 28 miRNAs to be differentially expressed (               P               {$<$} 0.05) with the majority being down-regulated in smokers. We further identified a number of mRNAs whose expression level is highly inversely correlated with miRNA expression in vivo. Many of these mRNAs contain potential binding sites for the differentially expressed miRNAs in their 3′-untranslated region (UTR) and are themselves affected by smoking. We found that either increasing or decreasing the levels of mir-218 (a miRNA that is strongly affected by smoking) in both primary bronchial epithelial cells and H1299 cells was sufficient to cause a corresponding decrease or increase in the expression of predicted mir-218 mRNA targets, respectively. Further, mir-218 expression is reduced in primary bronchial epithelium exposed to cigarette smoke condensate (CSC), and alteration of mir-218 levels in these cells diminishes the induction of the predicted mir-218 target MAFG in response to CSC. These data indicate that mir-218 levels modulate the airway epithelial gene expression response to cigarette smoke and support a role for miRNAs in regulating host response to environmental toxins.},

  abstract = {Abstract To fulfill the task of gas exchange, the lung possesses a huge inner surface and a tree-like system of conducting airways ventilating the gas exchange area. During lung development, the conducting airways are formed first, followed by the formation and enlargement of the gas exchange area. The latter (alveolarization) continues until young adulthood. During organogenesis, the left and right lungs have their own anlage, an outpouching of the foregut. Each lung bud starts a repetitive process of outgrowth and branching (branching morphogenesis) that forms all of the future airways mainly during the pseudoglandular stage. During the canalicular stage, the differentiation of the epithelia becomes visible and the bronchioalveolar duct junction is formed. The location of this junction stays constant throughout life. Towards the end of the canalicular stage, the first gas exchange may take place and survival of prematurely born babies becomes possible. Ninety percent of the gas exchange surface area will be formed by alveolarization, a process where existing airspaces are subdivided by the formation of new walls (septa). This process requires a double-layered capillary network at the basis of the newly forming septum. However, in parallel to alveolarization, the double-layered capillary network of the immature septa fuses to a single-layered network resulting in an optimized setup for gas exchange. Alveolarization still continues, because, at sites where new septa are lifting off preexisting mature septa, the required second capillary layer will be formed instantly by angiogenesis. The latter confirms a lifelong ability of alveolarization, which is important for any kind of lung regeneration.},

Deep sequencing recently facilitated the discovery of thousands of novel transcripts, now classified as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), in many vertebrate and invertebrate species. LncRNAs are involved in a wide range of cellular mechanisms, from almost all aspects of gene expression to protein translation and stability. Recent findings implicate lncRNAs as key players of cellular differentiation, cell lineage choice, organogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Moreover, lncRNAs are involved in pathological conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, and therefore provide novel biomarkers and pharmaceutical targets. Here we discuss examples illustrating the versatility of lncRNAs in gene control, development and differentiation, as well as in human disease.},

  abstract = {Elevated immune responses and the higher incidence of autoimmune diseases in female (compared to male) humans and animals have been known for a long time. However, the scientific interest in this interrelationship has been limited both amongst immunologists and endocrinologists. It is mainly in the last ten years that investigations in this area have been intensifying. A number of fairly recent review articles confirm the increased interest in various aspects of this “interdiscipline” [1–4]. In the present paper we should like to make a new assessment of the state of knowledge. We shall firstly discuss heteroimmune response differences between males and females in humans, rodents and birds and then the roles of gender and sex hormones in autoimmune disease in various species. The general conclusions are the following. Gender and sex hormones have a clear effect on various hetero- and auto-immune responses but the mechanisms of action are still unknown; starting from sex hormones, steroids can be devised which have favourable effects on immune processes but lack undesirable hormonal effects; such hormonomimetics should be, in principle, applicable for the treatment of autoimmune disease.},

The cross-sectional area of collagen and the percentage of abnormal myofibres in the post mortem diaphragm and psoas major were determined by computer-assisted image analysis of stained cross-sections of the diaphragm for collagen with picrosirius red and with haematoxylin and eosin for morphology. In the midcostal diaphragm of six subjects with COPD and six subjects with no significant respiratory disease, the COPD diaphragm displayed a greater cross-sectional area of collagen and percentage of abnormal myofibres (collagen: 24.2¡1.0 versus 18.6¡1.1\%; injury: 28.4¡7.2 versus 12.0¡1.3\%). In 18 patients with various respiratory conditions, the midcostal diaphragm displayed more collagen and abnormal myofibres than the crural diaphragm, while both costal and crural diaphragms displaying more collagen and abnormal myofibres than psoas major. This study reveals extensive injury and collagen accumulation in the chronic obstructive pulmonary diseased diaphragm, and reveals a regional pattern of injury and intramuscular collagen which may correspond to variations in diaphragm loading.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of tidal volume, breathing pattern, and beginning lung volume on the modulation of efferent, muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) in humans. In seven supine, healthy subjects, we measured MSNA (microneurography of the right peroneal nerve) and beat to beat arterial blood pressure during 1) low-frequency breathing (fb = 12 breaths/min) at tidal volumes (VT) of 30\% (control), 50\%, and 70\% of inspiratory capacity and with inspiratory time-to-total breath time ratios (TI/TTOT) of 0.3-0.5 (control), less than 0.3, and greater than 0.5; and 2) simulated exercise hyperpnea (fb = 40 breaths/min; VT = 60-70\% inspiratory capacity; minute ventilation, approximately 90 1). To optimize our ability to discern modulatory effects, breathing was performed during three conditions of heightened MSNA: nonhypotensive (less than 20 mm Hg) lower-body negative pressure, isometric handgrip exercise, and posthandgrip vascular occlusion (ischemia). PETCO2 was maintained at normal levels by adjusting the FICO2. Within-breath modulation of MSNA was observed during control tidal breathing with approximately 65\% of the burst frequency occurring during the expiratory phase. Deep, low-frequency breathing potentiated this modulatory influence (p less than 0.05 versus control) and produced near-complete sympathoinhibition from onset-mid inspiration to early-mid expiration. Increasing (slow inspiration) and decreasing (fast inspiration) TI/TTOT shifted the onset of sympathoinhibition occurring later (greater change in volume) and earlier (less change in volume) during inspiration, respectively. In two subjects who performed deep breathing from an elevated beginning lung volume, the sympathoinhibition was observed earlier in the inspiratory period and with less change in volume compared with control. These within-breath modulatory effects did not appear to be due solely to changes in arterial pressure. Sustained low- or high ("exerciselike")-frequency deep breathing did not alter total minute MSNA compared with control breathing. These results demonstrate that the depth and pattern of breathing, and possibly the starting lung volume, exert marked influences on the within-breath modulation of MSNA in humans. Our findings also suggest that these modulatory effects may be mediated, at least in part, by pulmonary stretch reflexes.},

  abstract = {Rationale Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread disease, with no curative therapies available. Recent findings suggest a key role of NO and sGC-cGMP signaling for the pathogenesis of the disease. Previous data suggest a downregulation/inactivation of the cGMP producing soluble guanylate cyclase, and sGC stimulation prevented cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and pulmonary hypertension (PH) in mice. We thus aimed to investigate if the inhibition of the cGMP degrading phosphodiesterase (PDE)5 has similar effects. Results were compared to the effects of a PDE 4 inhibitor (cAMP elevating) and a combination of both. Methods C57BL6/J mice were chronically exposed to cigarette smoke and in parallel either treated with Tadalafil (PDE5 inhibitor), Piclamilast (PDE4 inhibitor) or both. Functional measurements (lung compliance, hemodynamics) and structural investigations (alveolar and vascular morphometry) as well as the heart ratio were determined after 6 months of tobacco smoke exposure. In addition, the number of alveolar macrophages in the respective lungs was counted. Results Preventive treatment with Tadalafil, Piclamilast or a combination of both almost completely prevented the development of emphysema, the increase in lung compliance, tidal volume, structural remodeling of the lung vasculature, right ventricular systolic pressure, and right ventricular hypertrophy induced by cigarette smoke exposure. Single, but not combination treatment prevented or reduced smoke-induced increase in alveolar macrophages. Conclusion Cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and PH could be prevented by inhibition of the phosphodiesterases 4 and 5 in mice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic condition characterised by progressive airflow limitation that is at most partially reversible. Despite the lack of reversibility patients often report symptomatic improvement with short-acting beta-2 bronchodilator medication. Short-acting beta-2 bronchodilators are used in the management of both stable and acute exacerbations of COPD. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical effectiveness and assess the adverse effects of regular treatment with short-acting beta-2 agonists bronchodilators in patients with stable COPD. SEARCH STRATEGY: A search was carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group database. In addition, the reference lists of review articles and the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved in full text were searched for other potentially relevant citations. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs of at least one week in duration comparing treatment with inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonists with placebo in patients with stable COPD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and study quality assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. Where further or missing data was required, authors of studies were contacted. The data was analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager 4.1. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in this review. All studies used a crossover design and were of high quality. Spirometry performed at the end of the study period and after the administration of treatment (post-bronchodilator) showed a slight but significant increase in FEV1 and FVC when compared to placebo (WMD=0.14 L; 95\%CI=0.04,0.25 \& WMD=0.30 L; 95\%CI=0.02,0.58, respectively). In addition, both morning and evening PEFR were significantly better during active treatment than during placebo (WMD=29.17 L/min; 95\%CI=0.25,58.09 \& WMD=36.75 L/min; 95\%CI=2.56,70.94, respectively). A significant improvement in daily breathlessness score was observed during treatment with beta-2 agonist when compared to placebo (SMD=1.33; 95\%CI=1.0,1.65). The risk of dropping out of the study (treatment failure) when on treatment with placebo was almost twice that of patients on treatment with beta-2 agonists (RR=0.49; 95\%CI=0.33,0.73). Patients preferred beta-2 agonists almost 10 times more frequently to placebo (OR=9.04; 95\%CI=4.64,17.61). One study that used a validated questionnaire for 'quality of life' assessment, found highly significant improvements in the scores for dyspnoea (p=0.003) and fatigue (p=0.0003) during treatment with salbutamol. No studies reported serious side effects during treatment with inhaled beta-agonists. However, none of the studies were of sufficient length or size in order to allow any meaningful information on long-term occurrence of side effects. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Use of short-acting beta-2 agonists on a regular basis for at least seven days in stable COPD is associated with improvements in post bronchodilator lung function and a decrease in breathlessness. Patients are far more likely to prefer treatment with beta-2 agonists than placebo, and less likely to drop out from such treatment. None of the studies included in this review reported sufficient data or were of sufficient length or size in order to provide reliable information on adverse effects. Therefore large scale, parallel, longer term studies would be needed to investigate the effect of treatment with regular inhaled beta-2 agonists on mortality, disease progression and side effects. Newer, long acting bronchodilators (including long-acting beta-2 agonists) are currently available and they may be more practical and/or effective in these patients. However, this review indicates that treatment with these older, inexpensive drugs is beneficial in patients with COPD.},

  abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has rapidly become a popular tool to characterize transcriptomes. A fundamental research problem in many RNA-seq studies is the identification of reliable molecular markers that show differential expression between distinct sample groups. Together with the growing popularity of RNA-seq, a number of data analysis methods and pipelines have already been developed for this task. Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis links variations in gene expression levels to genotypes. For modern datasets, eQTL analysis is a computationally intensive task as it involves testing for association of billions of transcript-SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) pair. The heavy computational burden makes eQTL analysis less popular and sometimes forces analysts to restrict their attention to just a small subset of transcript-SNP pairs. As more transcripts and SNPs get interrogated over a growing number of samples, the demand for faster tools for eQTL analysis grows stronger. RESULTS: We have developed a new software for computationally efficient eQTL analysis called Matrix eQTL. In tests on large datasets, it was 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than existing popular tools for QTL/eQTL analysis, while finding the same eQTLs. The fast performance is achieved by special preprocessing and expressing the most computationally intensive part of the algorithm in terms of large matrix operations. Matrix eQTL supports additive linear and ANOVA models with covariates, including models with correlated and heteroskedastic errors. The issue of multiple testing is addressed by calculating false discovery rate; this can be done separately for cis- and trans-eQTLs.},

  abstract = {DLC1 is a RhoGAP-containing tumor suppressor that inhibits angiogenesis by repressing VEGF production in epithelial cells. Here we report the roles of DLC1 in endothelial cells. Silencing of DLC1 (siDLC1) enhances cell migration but reduces tube formation activities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Biochemically, RhoA activity and paxillin protein level are markedly increased in siDLC1 HUVECs. Although further silencing of RhoA restores the cell migration phenotype, the tube formation defect and up-regulated paxillin level remain unchanged. On the other hand, paxillin knockdown rescues tube formation and migration phenotypes but not the up-regulated RhoA activity. These results indicate that DLC1 regulates endothelial cell migration through RhoA and paxillin independently and controls tube formation mainly via paxillin. To further determine endothelial DLC1's function, we have generated endothelial specific knockout mice (DLC1-Tek). DLC1-Tek mice appear to be normal and healthy but their angiogenesis processes are compromised as shown in gel plug and aortic ring sprouting assays. Analysis of endothelial cells isolated from DLC1-Tek mice has further affirmed the cellular and biochemical phenotypes established in siDLC1 HUVECs. Our studies have demonstrated a positive regulatory role of endothelial DLC1 in angiogenesis.},

  abstract = {The prognostic role of resting pulmonary hyperinflation as measured by residual volume (RV)/total lung capacity (TLC) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the factors related to resting pulmonary hyperinflation in COPD and to determine whether resting pulmonary hyperinflation is a prognostic factor in COPD. In total, 353 patients with COPD in the Korean Obstructive Lung Disease cohort recruited from 16 hospitals were enrolled. Resting pulmonary hyperinflation was defined as RV/TLC ≥ 40\%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that older age (P = 0.001), lower forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (P {$<$} 0.001), higher St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score (P = 0.019), and higher emphysema index (P = 0.010) were associated independently with resting hyperinflation. Multivariate Cox regression model that included age, gender, dyspnea scale, SGRQ, RV/TLC, and 6-min walking distance revealed that an older age (HR = 1.07, P = 0.027), a higher RV/TLC (HR = 1.04, P = 0.025), and a shorter 6-min walking distance (HR = 0.99, P {$<$} 0.001) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. Our data showed that older age, higher emphysema index, higher SGRQ score, and lower FEV1 were associated independently with resting pulmonary hyperinflation in COPD. RV/TLC is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in COPD.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT           Organ- and body-scale cell atlases have the potential to transform our understanding of human biology. To capture the variability present in the population, these atlases must include diverse demographics such as age and ethnicity from both healthy and diseased individuals. The growth in both size and number of single-cell datasets, combined with recent advances in computational techniques, for the first time makes it possible to generate such comprehensive large-scale atlases through integration of multiple datasets. Here, we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA) combining 46 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.2 million cells from 444 individuals across health and disease. The HLCA contains a consensus re-annotation of published and newly generated datasets, resolving under- or misannotation of 59\% of cells in the original datasets. The HLCA enables recovery of rare cell types, provides consensus marker genes for each cell type, and uncovers gene modules associated with demographic covariates and anatomical location within the respiratory system. To facilitate the use of the HLCA as a reference for single-cell lung research and allow rapid analysis of new data, we provide an interactive web portal to project datasets onto the HLCA. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the HLCA reference for interpreting disease-associated changes. Thus, the HLCA outlines a roadmap for the development and use of organ-scale cell atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.},

  abstract = {Severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We have assembled a cohort of 44 probands with severe, early-onset COPD, who do not have severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. A surprisingly high prevalence of females (79.6\%) was found. Assessment of the risk to relatives of these early-onset COPD probands for airflow obstruction and chronic bronchitis was performed to determine whether significant familial aggregation for COPD, independent of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, could be demonstrated. Firstdegree relatives of early-onset COPD probands had significantly lower FEV1 and FEV1/FVC values than control subjects (p , 0.01), despite similar pack-years of smoking. Reduced spirometric values in firstdegree relatives of early-onset COPD probands were found only in current or ex-cigarette smokers. The mean FEV1 in current or ex-smoking first-degree relatives was 76.1 6 20.9\% predicted compared to 89.2 6 14.4\% predicted in current or ex-smoking control subjects (p , 0.01); in lifelong nonsmokers, the mean FEV1 was 93.4\% predicted for both control subjects and first-degree relatives of earlyonset COPD probands. Generalized estimating equations, adjusting for age and pack-years of smoking, demonstrated increased odds of reduced FEV1 and chronic bronchitis in current or ex-smoking first-degree relatives of early-onset COPD probands. Using a new method to estimate relative risk from relative odds, we estimate that the relative risks for FEV1 below 60\%, FEV1 below 80\%, and chronic bronchitis are each approximately three in current or ex-smoking first-degree relatives of early-onset COPD probands. The increased risk to relatives of early-onset COPD probands for reduced FEV1 and chronic bronchitis, limited to current or ex-smokers, suggests genetic risk factor(s) for COPD that are expressed in response to cigarette smoking.

  abstract = {In the process of matrix assembly, multivalent extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are induced to self-associate and to interact with other ECM proteins to form fibrillar networks. Matrix assembly is usually initiated by ECM glycoproteins binding to cell surface receptors, such as fibronectin (FN) dimers binding to α5β1 integrin. Receptor binding stimulates FN self-association mediated by the N-terminal assembly domain and organizes the actin cytoskeleton to promote cell contractility. FN conformational changes expose additional binding sites that participate in fibril formation and in conversion of fibrils into a stabilized, insoluble form. Once assembled, the FN matrix impacts tissue organization by contributing to the assembly of other ECM proteins. Here, we describe the major steps, molecular interactions, and cellular mechanisms involved in assembling FN dimers into fibrillar matrix while highlighting important issues and major questions that require further investigation.},

  abstract = {Analysis of DNA methylation helps to understand the effects of environmental exposures as well as the role of epigenetics in human health. Illumina, Inc. recently replaced the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K) with the EPIC BeadChip, which nearly doubles the measured CpG sites to {$>$}850,000. Although the new chip uses the same underlying technology, it is important to establish if data between the two platforms are comparable within cohorts and for meta-analyses. DNA methylation was assessed by 450K and EPIC using whole blood from newborn (n = 109) and 14-year-old (n = 86) participants of the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas. The overall per-sample correlations were very high (r {$>$}0.99), although many individual CpG sites, especially those with low variance of methylation, had lower correlations (median r = 0.24). There was also a small subset of CpGs with large mean methylation β-value differences between platforms, in both the newborn and 14-year datasets. However, estimates of cell type proportion prediction by 450K and EPIC were highly correlated at both ages. Finally, differentially methylated positions between boys and girls replicated very well by both platforms in newborns and older children. These findings are encouraging for application of combined data from EPIC and 450K platforms for birth cohorts and other population studies. These data in children corroborate recent comparisons of the two BeadChips in adults and in cancer cell lines. However, researchers should be cautious when characterizing individual CpG sites and consider independent methods for validation of significant hits.},

  abstract = {Abstract | Mitochondria contain about 1,000–1,500 proteins that fulfil multiple functions. Mitochondrial proteins originate from two genomes: mitochondrial and nuclear. Hence, proper mitochondrial function requires synchronization of gene expression in the nucleus and in mitochondria and necessitates efficient import of mitochondrial proteins into the organelle from the cytosol. Furthermore, the mitochondrial proteome displays high plasticity to allow the adaptation of mitochondrial function to cellular requirements. Maintenance of this complex and adaptable mitochondrial proteome is challenging, but is of crucial importance to cell function. Defects in mitochondrial proteostasis lead to proteotoxic insults and eventually cell death. Different quality control systems monitor the mitochondrial proteome. The cytosolic ubiquitinproteasome system controls protein transport across the mitochondrial outer membrane and removes damaged or mislocalized proteins. Concomitantly, a number of mitochondrial chaperones and proteases govern protein folding and degrade damaged proteins inside mitochondria. The quality control factors also regulate processing and turnover of native proteins to control protein import, mitochondrial metabolism, signalling cascades, mitochondrial dynamics and lipid biogenesis, further ensuring proper function of mitochondria. Thus, mitochondrial protein quality control mechanisms are of pivotal importance to integrate mitochondria into the cellular environment.},

This is a cross-sectional study of spirometries of 1,106 non-Hispanic Caucasian American adults, including 234 subjects with obstructive and 228 subjects with restrictive spirometric 'abnormalities'. A weighted Kappa statistic was used to evaluate the level of agreement between NHANES III and other commonly used reference standards. The level of agreement in assessing the presence of an 'abnormality' was poor to moderate-values of Kappa statistic ranged from 0.13 to 0.46. There was however, good to very good level of agreement in assessing the severity of the 'abnormality'-values of Kappa statistic ranged from 0.61 to 0.91. This study better quantifies the well-known differences in the interpretation of spirometric 'abnormalities' as a consequence of the recommended change of reference standard to NHANES III, which in turn may cause confusion among patients and their treating physicians.},

Using high-density gene expression arrays, we describe genes that are normally expressed in a subset of human airway epithelial cells obtained at bronchoscopy (the airway transcriptome), define how cigarette smoking alters the transcriptome, and detail the effects of variables, such as cumulative exposure, age, sex, and race, on cigarette smoke-induced changes in gene expression. We also determine which changes in gene expression are and are not reversible when smoking is discontinued. The persistent altered expression of a subset of genes in former smokers may explain the risk these individuals have for developing lung cancer long after they have discontinued smoking. The use of gene expression profiling to explore the normal biology of a specific subset of cells within a complex organ across a broad spectrum of healthy individuals and to define the reversible and irreversible genetic effects of cigarette smoke on human airway epithelial cells has not been previously reported.},

Prior studies have demonstrated that smoking creates a field of molecular injury throughout the airway epithelium exposed to cigarette smoke. We have previously characterized gene expression in the bronchial epithelium of never smokers and identified the gene expression changes that occur in the mainstem bronchus in response to smoking. In this study, we explored relationships in whole-genome gene expression between extrathorcic (buccal and nasal) and intrathoracic (bronchial) epithelium in healthy current and never smokers.                                         Results               Using genes that have been previously defined as being expressed in the bronchial airway of never smokers (the "normal airway transcriptome"), we found that bronchial and nasal epithelium from non-smokers were most similar in gene expression when compared to other epithelial and nonepithelial tissues, with several antioxidant, detoxification, and structural genes being highly expressed in both the bronchus and nose. Principle component analysis of previously defined smoking-induced genes from the bronchus suggested that smoking had a similar effect on gene expression in nasal epithelium. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that this set of genes was also highly enriched among the genes most altered by smoking in both nasal and buccal epithelial samples. The expression of several detoxification genes was commonly altered by smoking in all three respiratory epithelial tissues, suggesting a common airway-wide response to tobacco exposure.                                         Conclusion               Our findings support a relationship between gene expression in extra- and intrathoracic airway epithelial cells and extend the concept of a smoking-induced field of injury to epithelial cells that line the mouth and nose. This relationship could potentially be utilized to develop a non-invasive biomarker for tobacco exposure as well as a non-invasive screening or diagnostic tool providing information about individual susceptibility to smoking-induced lung diseases.},

The aim of the study was to develop the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) all-age reference values for T LCO. Data from 19 centres in 14 countries were collected to define T LCO reference values. Similar to the GLI spirometry project, reference values were derived using the LMS (lambda, mu, sigma) method and the GAMLSS (generalised additive models for location, scale and shape) programme in R. 12 660 T LCO measurements from asymptomatic, lifetime nonsmokers were submitted; 85\% of the submitted data were from Caucasians. All data were uncorrected for haemoglobin concentration. Following adjustments for elevation above sea level, gas concentration and assumptions used for calculating the anatomic dead space volume, there was a high degree of overlap between the datasets. Reference values for Caucasians aged 5–85 years were derived for T LCO, transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide and alveolar volume. This is the largest collection of normative T LCO data, and the first global reference values available for T LCO.},

  abstract = {Abstract | Evidence accumulated over the past decade shows that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely expressed and have key roles in gene regulation. Recent studies have begun to unravel how the biogenesis of lncRNAs is distinct from that of mRNAs and is linked with their specific subcellular localizations and functions. Depending on their localization and their specific interactions with DNA, RNA and proteins, lncRNAs can modulate chromatin function, regulate the assembly and function of membraneless nuclear bodies, alter the stability and translation of cytoplasmic mRNAs and interfere with signalling pathways. Many of these functions ultimately affect gene expression in diverse biological and physiopathological contexts, such as in neuronal disorders, immune responses and cancer. Tissue-specific and condition-specific expression patterns suggest that lncRNAs are potential biomarkers and provide a rationale to target them clinically. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms of lncRNA biogenesis, localization and functions in transcriptional, post-transcriptional and other modes of gene regulation, and their potential therapeutic applications.},

There is significant clinical, radiographic, and pathologic heterogeneity within smokers who develop COPD that likely reflects multiple molecular mechanisms of disease. It is possible that variations in the individual response to cigarette smoking form the basis for the distinct clinical and molecular phenotypes and variable natural history associated with COPD. Using the biologic premise of a molecular field of airway injury created by cigarette smoking, this response to tobacco exposure can be measured by molecular profiling of the airway epithelium. Noninvasive study of this field effect by profiling airway gene expression in patients with COPD holds important implications for our understanding of disease heterogeneity, early disease detection, and identification of novel disease-modifying therapies.},

  abstract = {ationale: Molecular phenotyping of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been impeded in part by the difficulty in obtaining lung tissue samples from individuals with impaired lung function. Objectives: We sought to determine whether COPD-associated processes are reflected in gene expression profiles of bronchial airway epithelial cells obtained by bronchoscopy. Methods: Gene expression profiling of bronchial brushings obtained from 238 current and former smokers with and without COPD was performed using Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST Arrays. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 98 genes whose expression levels were associated with COPD status, FEV1\% predicted, and FEV1/FVC. In silico analysis identified activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) as a potential transcriptional regulator of genes with COPD-associated airway expression, and ATF4 overexpression in airway epithelial cells in vitro recapitulates COPD-associated gene expression changes. Genes with COPD-associated expression in the bronchial airway epithelium had similarly altered expression profiles in prior studies performed on small-airway epithelium and lung parenchyma, suggesting that transcriptomic alterations in the bronchial airway epithelium reflect molecular events found at more distal sites of disease activity. Many of the airway COPD-associated gene expression changes revert toward baseline after therapy with the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone in independent cohorts. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate a molecular field of injury throughout the bronchial airway of active and former smokers with COPD that may be driven in part by ATF4 and is modifiable with therapy. Bronchial airway epithelium may ultimately serve as a relatively accessible tissue in which to measure biomarkers of disease activity for guiding clinical management of COPD.},

Most, if not all humans, contain multiple mtDNA genotypes (heteroplasmy), specific patterns of variants accumulate in different tissues over time (including cancers), and some are preferentially passed down or suppressed in the maternal germ line. These findings cast light on the origin and spread of mtDNA mutations at multiple scales, from the organelle to the human population, and challenge the conventional view that high percentage levels of a mutation are required before a new variant has functional consequences.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

A total of 26 former smokers (mean age 72.7 ±7.5 years; 57.7\% female) with COPD (≥ Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease Stage 2) were followed for up to 4 months, during which they recorded daily oxygenation, lung function, and inhaler/nebulizer use. Differences in these health measures were assessed in association with self-reported worsening symptoms and COPD exacerbations, as defined by validated questionnaire. We collected 2451 observations with spirometry and questionnaire data and identified 253 symptom days (10.3\%) and 47 (1.92\%) exacerbation days. In linear mixed effects models adjusted for age, sex, race, height, weight, and season, each respiratory symptom reported worse than baseline was associated with a 0.19 percentage point (95\% CI -0.31 to -0.07) lower daily oxygen saturation (p=0.002). On major symptom days (defined as worse-than-baseline dyspnea, sputum purulence or sputum amount), oxygen saturation was 0.56 percentage points lower (95\% CI -0.89 to -0.23, p=0.001) than days without increased major symptoms. We found no association of symptom days or exacerbations with forced expiratory volume in 1 second. There were 8 reports of increased inhaler/nebulizer use from baseline on symptom days (1.5\% of 253). In this moderate-to-severe COPD population, worsening respiratory symptoms were common and associated with lower oxygenation. However, participants did not selftreat symptoms with increased inhaler/nebulizer use, which may suggest poor perceived clinical benefit from short-acting bronchodilators and a potential target for patient education.},

We have found that re-expression of DIRAS3, a RAS-related small GTPase tumor suppressor that is downregulated in multiple cancers, inhibits RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling by interacting directly with RAS-forming heteromers, disrupting RAS clustering, inhibiting Raf kinase activation, and inhibiting transformation and growth of cancer cells and xenografts. Disruption of K-RAS cluster formation requires the N terminus of DIRAS3 and interaction of both DIRAS3 and K-RAS with the plasma membrane. Interaction of DIRAS3 with both K-RAS and H-RAS suggests a strategy for inhibiting oncogenic RAS function.},

A wide variety of tRNA modifications are found in the tRNA anticodon, which are crucial for precise codon recognition and reading frame maintenance, thereby ensuring accurate and efficient protein synthesis. In addition, tRNA-body regions are also frequently modified and thus stabilized in the cell. Over the past two decades, 16 novel tRNA modifications were discovered in various organisms, and the chemical space of tRNA modification continues to expand. Recent studies have revealed that tRNA modifications can be dynamically altered in response to levels of cellular metabolites and environmental stresses. Importantly, we now understand that deficiencies in tRNA modification can have pathological consequences, which are termed ‘RNA modopathies’. Dysregulation of tRNA modification is involved in mitochondrial diseases, neurological disorders and cancer.},

Interactions in STRING are provided with a confidence score, and accessory information such as protein domains and 3D structures is made available, all within a stable and consistent identifier space. New features in STRING include an interactive network viewer that can cluster networks on demand, updated on-screen previews of structural information including homology models, extensive data updates and strongly improved connectivity and integration with third-party resources.

FVC and FEV1 decline with age, while volumes and capacities, such as RV and FRC, increase. TLC, VC, RV, FVC and FEV1 are affected by height, since they are proportional to body size. This means that a tall individual will experience greater decrease in lung volumes as they get older. Some variables, such as FRC and ERV, decline exponentially with an increase in weight, to the extent that tidal volume in morbidly obese patients can be close to that of RV. Men have longer airways than women, causing greater specific resistance in the respiratory tract. The increased work of breathing to increase ventilation among women means that their consumption of oxygen is higher than men under similar conditions of physical intensity. Lung volumes are higher when the subject is standing than in other positions. DLCO is significantly higher in supine positions than in sitting or standing positions, but the difference between sitting and standing positions is not significant. Anthropometric characteristics are insufficient to explain differences in lung function between different ethnic groups, underlining the importance of considering other factors in addition to the conventional anthropometric measurements.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Accurate prediction of lung cancer risk is of value for individuals, clinicians, and researchers. The aims of this study were to characterize the associations between pulmonary function and sputum DNA image cytometry (SDIC) and lung cancer, and their contributions to risk prediction. During 1990 to 2007, 2,596 high-risk individuals were enrolled and followed prospectively for development of lung cancer (n ¼ 139; median follow-up 7.7 years) in trials at the British Columbia Cancer Agency. At baseline, an epidemiologic questionnaire was administered, sputum was collected for aneuploidy measurement and spirometry was obtained. Multivariable logistic models were prepared including known lung cancer predictors (model 1), that additionally included percent-expected-forced expiratory volume in 1 second [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\%), model 2], and that additionally included SDIC (model 3). Prediction was assessed by evaluating discrimination (receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC)) and calibration. Net reclassification indices (NRI) were calculated with cutoff points for 8-year risks identifying low, intermediate, and high risk at 1.5\% and 3\%. Lung cancer risk increased with decline in FEV1\%, but did so more for men than for women (interaction P {$<$} 0.001). SDIC demonstrated a dose–response with lung cancer (P ¼ 0.022). The ROC AUCs for models 1, 2, and 3 were 0.718 (95\% CI: 0.671–0.765), 0.767 (95\% CI: 0.725–0.809), and 0.773 (95\% CI: 0.732–0.815), respectively. Model 2 versus 1 had a NRI of 12.6\% (P {$<$} 0.0001) and model 3 versus 2 had a NRI of 3.1\% (P ¼ 0.059). Spirometry and SDIC data substantially and minimally improved lung cancer prediction, respectively.},

The goal of this research is to study and to understand the framework of the Bayesian networks, and then to construct gene regulatory networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle gene expression dataset and Escherichia coli dataset by developing Bayesian networks using hill-climbing algorithm and Efron’s bootstrap approach and then the performance of the constructed gene networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are evaluated and are compared with the previously constructed sub-networks by Dejori [14]. At the end of this research, the gene networks constructed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae not only have achieved high True Positive Rate (more than 90\%), but the networks constructed also have discovered more potential interactions between genes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the performance of the gene regulatory networks constructed using Bayesian networks in this research is proved to be better because it can reveal more gene relationships. 				 				Dalam penyelidikan ini, Bayesian network adalah dicadangkan sebagai model untuk membina gene regulatory networks dari kitar sel S. cerevisiae set data disebabkan keupayaannya untuk mengendali set data microarray yang mempunyai nilai-nilai yang hilang. Tujuan penyelidikan ini adalah untuk mempelajari dan memahami rekabentuk untuk Bayesian network, dan kemudian untuk membina gene regulatory networks dari data Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-cycle gene expression dan data Escherichia coli dengan membina model Bayesian networks dengan menggunakan algoritma hill-climbing serta Efron’s bootstrap approach dan gene networks yang dibina untuk Saccharomyces cerevisiae dibandingkan dengan sub-networks yang dibina oleh Dejori [14]. Pada akhir kajian ini, gene networks yang dibina untuk Saccharomyces cerevisiae bukan sahaja telah mencapai True Positive Rate yang tinggi (lebih dari 90\%), tetapi gene networks yang dibina juga telah menemui lebih banyak interaksi berpotensi antara gen. Oleh kerana itu, dapat disimpulkan bahawa prestasi gene networks yang dibina menggunakan Bayesian network dalam kajian ini adalah terbukti lebih baik kerana ia boleh mendedahkan lebih banyak hubungan antara gen.},

  abstract = {Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) is a common feature in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is associated with worse prognosis and quality of life. This study aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA)–mRNA regulatory networks underlying CMH.             The expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA in bronchial biopsies from 63 COPD patients were associated with CMH using linear regression. Potential mRNA targets of each CMH-associated miRNA were identified using Pearson correlations. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and STRING (search tool for the retrieval of interacting genes/proteins) analysis were used to identify key genes and pathways.                            20 miRNAs and 539 mRNAs were differentially expressed with CMH in COPD. The expression of 10 miRNAs was significantly correlated with the expression of one or more mRNAs. Of these, miR-134-5p, miR-146a-5p and the let-7 family had the highest representation of CMH-associated mRNAs among their negatively correlated predicted targets.               KRAS               and               EDN1               were identified as key regulators of CMH and were negatively correlated predicted targets of miR-134-5p and let-7a-5p, let-7d-5p, and let-7f-5p, respectively. GSEA suggested involvement of               MUC5AC               -related genes and several other relevant gene sets in CMH. The lower expression of miR-134-5p was confirmed in primary airway fibroblasts from COPD patients with CMH.

  abstract = {Abstract Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) is prevalent in both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is associated with more severe symptoms. Recently, we identified several microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with CMH in COPD. In this study, we extended our analysis to CMH in asthma. Using small RNA sequencing and RNA sequencing profiles of bronchial biopsies from 65 asthmatic patients, we identified 17 miRNAs associated with CMH in asthma. When comparing them to our previously published dataset in COPD, we found a positive association of miR-31-5p with CMH in both diseases. MiR-31-5p was negatively correlated with multiple predicted targets, including ST3GAL2, PITPNM2, and ARHGEF15 which were also associated with CMH. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed the enrichment of MUC5AC-associated gene set and CMHassociated gene set in COPD among CMH-associated genes in asthma. Our findings suggest CMH in asthma and COPD share common regulatory mechanisms mediated, at least in part, by miR-31-5p. This study provides novel insights that could contribute to the development of CMH-targeted therapy that efficiently benefits both asthma and COPD patients.},

Many questions about its origins, its unusual epidemiologic features, and the basis of its pathogenicity remain unanswered. The public health implications of the pandemic therefore remain in doubt even as we now grapple with the feared emergence of a pandemic caused by H5N1 or other virus. However, new information about the 1918 virus is emerging, for example, sequencing of the entire genome from archival autopsy tissues. But, the viral genome alone is unlikely to provide answers to some critical questions. Understanding the 1918 pandemic and its implications for future pandemics requires careful experimentation and in-depth historical analysis.},

  abstract = {Background: To investigate if age, gender and smoking are associated with airway wall thickness (AWT) measured by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and if higher AWT is associated with lower levels of pulmonary function in healthy current- and never-smokers with a wide age range. Methods: HRCT scans were performed in 99 subjects (48 never- and 51 current-smokers, median age 39 years [IQR 22 – 54], 57\% males). The AWT at an internal perimeter of 10 mm (AWT Pi10) was calculated as an overall measurement of AWT, based on all measurements throughout the lungs. Extensive pulmonary function testing was performed in all subjects. Results: Higher age was associated with a lower AWT Pi10 (b = −0.003, p {$<$} 0.001). Current-smokers had a higher AWT Pi10 than never-smokers (mean 0.49 mm versus 0.44 mm, p = 0.022). In multivariate analysis, age and current-smoking were independently associated with AWT Pi10 (age b = −0.002, p {$<$} 0.001, current-smoking b = 0.041, p = 0.021), whereas gender was not (b = 0.011, p = 0.552). Higher AWT Pi10 was associated with a lower FEV1,FEV1/FVC, FEF25–75 and higher R5, R20 and X5. Conclusions: AWT decreases with higher age, possibly reflecting structural changes of the airways. Additionally, current-smokers have a higher AWT, possibly due to remodeling or inflammation. Finally, higher AWT is associated with a lower level of pulmonary function, even in this population of healthy subjects.},

  abstract = {Mucins are important components that exert a variety of functions in cell-cell interaction, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, and airways protection. In the conducting airways of the lungs, mucins are the major contributor to the viscoelastic property of mucous secretion, which is the major barrier to trapping inhaled microbial organism, particulates, and oxidative pollutants. The homeostasis of mucin production is an important feature in conducting airways for the maintenance of mucociliary function. Aberrant mucin secretion and accumulation in airway lumen are clinical hallmarks associated with various lung diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, emphysema, and lung cancer. Among 20 known mucin genes identified, 11 of them have been verified at either the mRNA and/or protein level in airways. The regulation of mucin genes is complicated, as are the mediators and signaling pathways. This review summarizes the current view on the mediators, the signaling pathways, and the transcriptional units that are involved in the regulation of airway mucin gene expression. In addition, we also point out essential features of epigenetic mechanisms for the regulation of these genes.},

The biochemical milieu is known to affect mitochondrial function and contribute to the dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotypes implicated in cancer and the morbidities of aging. However, the physical characteristics of the extracellular matrix are also altered in cancerous and aging tissues. Here, we demonstrate that cells sense the physical properties of the extracellular matrix and activate a mitochondrial stress response that adaptively tunes mitochondrial function via solute carrier family 9 member A1-dependent ion exchange and heat shock factor 1-dependent transcription. Overall, our data indicate that adhesion-mediated mechanosignaling may play an unappreciated role in the altered mitochondrial functions observed in aging and cancer.},

  abstract = {Background: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with bronchial epithelial changes, including squamous cell metaplasia and goblet cell hyperplasia. These features are partially attributed to activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Whereas smoking cessation reduces respiratory symptoms and lung function decline in COPD, inflammation persists. We determined epithelial proliferation and composition in bronchial biopsies from current and ex-smokers with COPD, and its relation to duration of smoking cessation. Methods: 114 COPD patients were studied cross-sectionally: 99 males/15 females, age 62 ± 8 years, median 42 pack-years, no corticosteroids, current (n = 72) or ex-smokers (n = 42, median cessation duration 3.5 years), postbronchodilator FEV1 63 ± 9\% predicted. Squamous cell metaplasia (\%), goblet cell (PAS/Alcian Blue+) area (\%), proliferating (Ki-67+) cell numbers (/mm basement membrane), and EGFR expression (\%) were measured in intact epithelium of bronchial biopsies. Results: Ex-smokers with COPD had significantly less epithelial squamous cell metaplasia, proliferating cell numbers, and a trend towards reduced goblet cell area than current smokers with COPD (p = 0.025, p = 0.001, p = 0.081, respectively), but no significant difference in EGFR expression. Epithelial features were not different between short-term quitters ({$<$}3.5 years) and current smokers. Long-term quitters (≥3.5 years) had less goblet cell area than both current smokers and short-term quitters (medians: 7.9\% vs. 14.4\%, p = 0.005; 7.9\% vs. 13.5\%, p = 0.008; respectively), and less proliferating cell numbers than current smokers (2.8\% vs. 18.6\%, p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: Ex-smokers with COPD had less bronchial epithelial remodelling than current smokers, which was only observed after long-term smoking cessation ({$>$}3.5 years).},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP) play an important role in the defense against inhaled toxicants, and expression of CYP enzymes may differ among various lung cells and tissue compartments. METHODS: We studied the effects of tobacco smoke in volunteers and investigated gene expression of 19 CYPs and 3 flavin-containing monooxygenases, as well as isoforms of gluthathione S-transferases (GST) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) and the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and bronchial biopsies derived from smokers (n = 8) and nonsmokers (n = 10). We also investigated gene expression of nuclear transcription factors known to be involved in the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism enzymes. RESULTS: Gene expression of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2S1, GSTP1, and EPHX1 was induced in bronchoalveolar lavage cells of smokers, whereas expression of CYP2B6/7, CYP3A5, and UGT2A1 was repressed. In bronchial biopsies of smokers, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP2C9, GSTP1, and GSTA2 were induced, but CYP2J2 and EPHX1 were repressed. Induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 transcript abundance resulted in increased activity of the coded enzyme. Finally, expression of the liver X receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor was significantly up-regulated in bronchoalveolar lavage cells of smokers. CONCLUSIONS: We found gene expression of pulmonary xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes and certain key transcription factors to be regulated in bronchoalveolar lavage cells and bronchial biopsies of smokers. The observed changes demonstrate tissue specificity in xenobiotic metabolism, with likely implications for the metabolic activation of procarcinogens to ultimate carcinogens of tobacco smoke.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is induced by cigarette smoking and characterized by inflammation of airway tissue. Since smokers with COPD have a higher risk of developing lung cancer than those without, we hypothesized that they carry more mutations in affected tissue. We called somatic mutations in airway brush samples from medium-coverage whole genome sequencing data from healthy never and ex-smokers (n\,=\,8), as well as from ex-smokers with variable degrees of COPD (n\,=\,4). Owing to the limited concordance of resulting calls between the applied tools we built a consensus, a strategy that was validated with high accuracy for cancer data. However, consensus calls showed little promise of representing true positives due to low mappability of corresponding sequence reads and high overlap with positions harbouring known genetic polymorphisms. A targeted re-sequencing approach suggested that only few mutations would survive stringent verification testing and that our data did not allow the inference of any difference in the mutational load of bronchial brush samples between former smoking COPD cases and controls. High polyclonality in airway brush samples renders medium-depth sequencing insufficient to provide the resolution to detect somatic mutations. Deep sequencing data of airway biopsies are needed to tackle the question.},

  abstract = {Pathological features of both asthma and COPD coexist in some patients and this is termed asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). ACO is heterogeneous and patients exhibit various combinations of asthma and COPD features, making it difficult to characterise the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. There are no controlled studies that define effective therapies for ACO, which arises from the lack of international consensus on the definition and diagnostic criteria for ACO, as well as scant               in vitro               and               in vivo               data. There remain unmet needs for experimental models of ACO that accurately recapitulate the hallmark features of ACO in patients. The development and interrogation of such models will identify underlying disease-causing mechanisms, as well as enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and providing a platform for assessing new ACO therapies. Here, we review the current understanding of the clinical features of ACO and highlight the approaches that are best suited for developing representative experimental models of ACO.},

After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure               1               . Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold               2               , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool~that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

  abstract = {As knowledge of airways disease has grown, it has become apparent that neither chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) nor asthma is a simple, easily defined disease. In the past, treatment options for both diseases were limited; thus, there was less need to define subgroups. As treatment options have grown, so has our need to predict who will respond to new drugs. To date, identifying subgroups has been largely reported by detailed clinical characterisation or differences in pathobiology. These subgroups are commonly called “phenotypes”; however, the problem of defining what constitutes a phenotype, whether this should include comorbid diseases and how to handle changes over time has led to the term being used loosely.             In this review, we describe subgroups of COPD and asthma patients whose clinical characteristics we believe have therapeutic or major prognostic implications specific to the lung, and whether these subgroups are constant over time. Finally, we will discuss whether the subgroups we describe are common to both asthma and COPD, and give some examples of how treatment might be tailored in patients where the subgroup is clear, but the label of asthma or COPD is not.},

  abstract = {Background A core feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the accelerated decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). The recent Groningen and Leiden Universities study of Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease (GLUCOLD) study suggested that particular phenotypes of COPD benefitfromfluticasone±salmeterol by reducing the rate of FEV1 decline, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Methods Whole-genome gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix Gene ST array (V.1.0) was performed on 221 bronchial biopsies available from 89 COPD patients at baseline and after 6 and 30 months of fluticasone±salmeterol and placebo treatment in GLUCOLD. Results Linear mixed effects modelling revealed that the expression of 138 genes decreased, whereas the expression of 140 genes significantly upregulated after both 6 and 30 months of treatment with fluticasone ±salmeterol versus placebo. A more pronounced treatment-induced change in the expression of 50 and 55 of these 278 genes was associated with a lower rate of decline in FEV1 and Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire, respectively. Genes decreasing with treatment were involved in pathways related to cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial cell signalling, p53 signalling and T cell signalling. Genes increasing with treatment were involved in pathways related to focal adhesion, gap junction and extracellular matrix deposition. Finally, the fluticasone-induced gene expression changes were enriched among genes that change in the airway epithelium in smokers with versus without COPD in an independent data set. Conclusions The present study suggests that gene expression in biological pathways of COPD is dynamic with treatment and reflects disease activity. This study opens the gate to targeted and molecular phenotypedriven therapy of COPD.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: The new Global Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines advice to focus treatment in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) on improvement of functional state, prevention of disease progression and minimization of symptoms. So far no validated questionnaires are available to measure symptom and functional state in daily clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and validate the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). Methods: Qualitative research with patients and clinicians was performed to generate possible items to evaluate clinical COPD control. Thereafter, an item reduction questionnaire was sent to 77 international experts. Sixty-seven experts responded and the 10 most important items, divided into 3 domains (symptoms, functional and mental state) were included in the CCQ (scale: 0 = best, 6 = worst). Results: Cross-sectional data were collected from 119 subjects (57 COPD, GOLD stage I-III; 18 GOLD stage 0 and 44 (ex)smokers). Cronbach's α was high (0.91). The CCQ scores in patients (GOLD 0-III) were significantly higher than in healthy (ex)smokers. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between the CCQ total score and domains of the SF-36 (ρ = 0.48 to ρ = 0.69) and the SGRQ (ρ = 0.67 to ρ = 0.72). In patients with COPD, the correlation between the CCQ and FEV1\%pred was ρ =-0.49. Test-retest reliability was determined in 20 subjects in a 2week interval (Intra Class Coefficient = 0.94). Thirty-six smokers with and without COPD showed significant improvement in the CCQ after 2 months smoking cessation, indicating the responsiveness of the CCQ. Conclusion: The CCQ is a self-administered questionnaire specially developed to measure clinical control in patients with COPD. Data support the validity, reliability and responsiveness of this short and easy to administer questionnaire.},

Objective: To study the involvement of B cells in the development of emphysema. Methods: The presence of B-cell follicles and their interaction with other cells were investigated in lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and of smoking mice. B cells were isolated from lymphoid follicles by laser microdissection and analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin rearrangements and somatic mutations. Main Results: Lymphoid follicles consisting of B cells and follicular dendritic cells with adjacent T cells were demonstrated both in the parenchyma and in bronchial walls of patients with emphysema. A clonal process was observed in all follicles and the presence of ongoing somatic mutations was observed in 75\% of the follicles, indicating oligoclonal, antigen-specific proliferation. Similar lymphoid follicles were detected in mice that had developed pulmonary inflammation and progressive alveolar airspace enlargement after smoking. The increase in the number of B-cell follicles was progressive with time and correlated with the increase in mean linear intercept. Specific bacterial or viral nucleic acids could not be detected. Conclusions: B-cell follicles with an oligoclonal, antigen-specific reaction were found in men and mice with emphysema. In mice, the development was progressive with time and correlated with the increase in airspace enlargement. We hypothesize that these B cells contribute to the inflammatory process and/or the development and perpetuation of emphysema by producing antibodies against either tobacco smoke residues or extracellular matrix components.},

Methods                                We genotyped 1390 subjects from the Vlagtwedde/Vlaardingen cohort. Lung function was measured every 3 years for a period of 25 years. We tested whether five SNPs in                 decorin                 (3'UTR and four intron SNPs) and three SNPs in                 TGF-β                                    1                                  (3'UTR rs6957, C-509T rs1800469 and Leu10Pro rs1982073), and their haplotypes, were associated with COPD (last survey GOLD stage = II).

  abstract = {Abstract             Smoking is a leading cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is known to have a significant impact on gene expression and (inflammatory) cell populations in the airways involved in COPD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the impact of smoking on the expression of miRNAs in healthy and COPD individuals. We aimed to elucidate the overall smoking-induced miRNA changes and those specific to COPD. In addition, we investigated the downstream effects on regulatory gene expression and the correlation to cellular composition. We performed a genome-wide miRNA expression analysis on a dataset of 40 current- and 22 ex-smoking COPD patients and a dataset of 35 current- and 38 non-smoking respiratory healthy controls and validated the results in an independent dataset. miRNA expression was then correlated with mRNA expression in the same patients to assess potential regulatory effects of the miRNAs. Finally, cellular deconvolution analysis was used to relate miRNAs changes to specific cell populations. Current smoking was associated with increased expression of three miRNAs in the COPD patients and 18 miRNAs in the asymptomatic smokers compared to respiratory healthy controls. In comparison, four miRNAs were lower expressed with current smoking in asymptomatic controls. Two of the three smoking-related miRNAs in COPD, miR-203a-3p and miR-375, were also higher expressed with current smoking in COPD patients and the asymptomatic controls. The other smoking-related miRNA in COPD patients, i.e. miR-31-3p, was not present in the respiratory healthy control dataset. miRNA-mRNA correlations demonstrated that miR-203a-3p, miR-375 and also miR-31-3p expression were negatively associated with genes involved in pro-inflammatory pathways and positively associated with genes involved in the xenobiotic pathway. Cellular deconvolution showed that higher levels of miR-203a-3p were associated with higher proportions of proliferating-basal cells and secretory (club and goblet) cells and lower levels of fibroblasts, luminal macrophages, endothelial cells, B-cells, amongst other cell types. MiR-375 expression was associated with lower levels of secretory cells, ionocytes and submucosal cells, but higher levels of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and mast cells, amongst other cell types. In conclusion, we identified two smoking-induced miRNAs (miR-375 and miR-203a-3p) that play a role in regulating inflammation and detoxification pathways, regardless of the presence or absence of COPD. Additionally, in patients with COPD, we identified miR-31-3p as a miRNA induced by smoking. Our identified miRNAs should be studied further to unravel which smoking-induced inflammatory mechanisms are reactive and which are involved in COPD pathogenesis.},

We studied collagens, laminin, fibronectin, proteoglycans (PGs), and beta1-integrins. The majority of the patients with severe emphysema showed diminished staining for the interstitial PGs, decorin and biglycan, in the peribronchiolar area, compared with patients in the control and fibrosis groups. Only a minority of patients with mild emphysema showed this diminished staining. In contrast, decorin and biglycan were well preserved in the perivascular area of all of the specimens from the emphysema group. Heparan sulfate PG staining was diminished in the respiratory airspace walls of patients with emphysema and fibrosis. Staining for Types I, III, and IV collagen, as well as for laminin, fibronectin, and the integrins, showed no differences between the four groups. The specific loss of interstitial PGs may be crucial for elastic recoil loss and subsequent bronchiolar obstruction, as seen in patients with smoking-related emphysema.},

  abstract = {Humans are widely exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, commonly found in cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust. These can undergo site- and cell-specific metabolism to cytotoxic intermediates. Metabolism of naphthalene and Clara cell cytotoxicity have been extensively studied in male animals. To address whether male and female mice are equally susceptible to naphthalene, mice were injected with naphthalene, and lungs were examined 1, 2, 3, 6, and 24 h after treatment. By analysis of acute injury using differential permeability to fluorescent nuclear dyes and high-resolution histopathology, injury in female mice was found to be more extensive, occur earlier, and include permeable cells in proximal airways, including airway bifurcations. HPLC analysis of the products of cytochrome P-450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism in microdissected airways indicated that although both genders produced a predominance of products from CYP2F2, female mice produced more naphthalene dihydrodiol in distal airways, the primary sites of injury. We conclude that there are clear gender differences in susceptibility to naphthalene-induced injury and that differences in metabolism of naphthalene may play a role in elevated susceptibility in female mice.},

  abstract = {Approximately 40\% of asthmatics experience remission of asthma symptoms. A better understanding of biological pathways leading to asthma remission may provide insight into new therapeutic targets for asthma. As an important mechanism of gene regulation, investigation of DNA methylation provides a promising approach. Our objective was to identify differences in epigenome wide DNA methylation levels in bronchial biopsies between subjects with asthma remission and subjects with persistent asthma or healthy controls.             We analysed differential DNA methylation in bronchial biopsies from 26 subjects with persistent asthma, 39 remission subjects and 70 healthy controls, using the limma package. The comb-p tool was used to identify differentially methylated regions. DNA methylation of CpG-sites was associated to expression of nearby genes from the same biopsies to understand function.                            Four CpG-sites and 42 regions were differentially methylated between persistent asthma and remission. DNA methylation at two sites was correlated               i               n               cis               with gene expression at               ACKR2               and               DGKQ               . Between remission subjects and healthy controls 1163 CpG-sites and 328 regions were differentially methylated. DNA methylation was associated with expression of a set of genes expressed in ciliated epithelium.                                         CpGs differentially methylated between remission and persistent asthma identify genetic loci associated with resolution of inflammation and airway responsiveness. Despite the absence of symptoms, remission subjects have a DNA methylation profile that is distinct from that of healthy controls, partly due to changes in cellular composition, with a higher gene expression signal related to ciliated epithelium in remission               versus               healthy controls.},

  abstract = {In addition to their effects on sexual differentiation and reproduction, sex hormones influence the immune system. This results in a gender dimorphism in the immune function with females having higher immunoglobulin levels and mounting stronger immune responses following immunization or infection than males. The greater immune responsiveness in females is also evident in their increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. However, a clear understanding of the myriad of effects that sex hormones have on the immune system is lacking. Studies in normal mice show that estrogen treatment induces polyclonal B cell activation with increased expression of autoantibodies characteristic of autoimmune diseases. Several mechanisms appear to contribute to the break in tolerance and the increase in plasma cell activity including a reduction of the mass of the bone marrow and the thymus, the emergence of sites of extrameduallary hematopoiesis and altered susceptibility of B cells to cell death. In addition, sex hormone levels in both humans and experimental models correlated with the activity of their cytokine-secreting cells indicating that sex hormones influence the cytokine milieu and suggesting that altered sex hormonal levels in autoimmune patients contribute to the skewed cytokine milieu characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While sex hormones alone do not cause autoimmune disease, abnormal hormone levels may provide the stage for other factors (genetic, infectious) to trigger disease. Understanding the physiology of the interaction between sex hormones and immune function and its potential pathological consequences may provide insight into the autoimmune diseases and new directions for their treatment.},

  abstract = {Summary Study objectives: The aim of this analysis was to understand the implications of the GOLD 2011 multidimensional system for the assessment and management of COPD, using data from a real- world observational study. Methods: Data were drawn from the Adelphi Respiratory Disease Specific Programme, a cross- sectional survey of consulting patients in five European countries and in the US undertaken be- tween June and September 2011. Patients were classified using both the GOLD 2010 and revised GOLD 2011 criteria, and profiled with regards to demographics, disease characteristics and treatment patterns. Results: Information on 3813 COPD patients was collected. Disease characteristics showed a general tendency to worsen in parallel with worsening of symptoms. When comparing dual versus single risk criteria, the inclusion of exacerbation history resulted in an increase in the number of patients in high risk groups. The highest proportions of patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were in group D. However, a considerable proportion of patients in low risk groups were receiving ICS/long-acting b2 agonists. Conclusions: Our analysis confirmed the relationship between higher symptomatic burden, increased airflow limitation and exacerbation, and further illustrated the importance of including exacerbation history in the assessment of COPD to identify patients at high risk. As based on data from current clinical practice, this study also highlighted the frequent and potentially inappropriate use of ICS and bronchodilators in patients at low risk of experiencing exacerbations.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently a leading cause of death worldwide, and its burden is expected to rise in the coming years. Common COPD symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. Some patients may experience acute worsening of symptoms (known as an exacerbation), and therefore require additional therapy. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory infections and environmental factors. Healthcare professionals face many challenges in COPD management, including the heterogeneity of the disease and under-reporting of symptoms. The authors review these challenges and provide recommendations for the best methods to assess COPD. The goals of COPD treatment include recognising the impact that both symptoms and exacerbations have on patients’ lives when considering optimal patient-focused management. The review discusses the need for COPD management strategies to include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches and provides recommendations for monitoring treatment outcomes and adjusting management strategies accordingly. Novel treatment strategies including precision medicine and point-of-care testing are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events. The database STRING is a precomputed global resource for the exploration and analysis of these associations. Since the three types of evidence differ conceptually, and the number of predicted interactions is very large, it is essential to be able to assess and compare the significance of individual predictions. Thus, STRING contains a unique scoring-framework based on benchmarks of the different types of associations against a common reference set, integrated in a single confidence score per prediction. The graphical representation of the network of inferred, weighted protein interactions provides a high-level view of functional linkage, facilitating the analysis of modularity in biological processes. STRING is updated continuously, and currently contains 261 033 orthologs in 89 fully sequenced genomes. The database predicts functional interactions at an expected level of accuracy of at least 80\% for more than half of the genes; it is online at http://www.bork.embl-heidelberg.de/STRING/.},

From a functional perspective, 'association' can mean direct physical binding, but can also mean indirect interaction such as participation in the same metabolic pathway or cellular process.

STRING aims to simplify access to this information by providing a comprehensive, yet quality-controlled collection of protein-protein associations for a large number of organisms. The associations are derived from high-throughput experimental data, from the mining of databases and literature, and from predictions based on genomic context analysis. STRING integrates and ranks these associations by benchmarking them against a common reference set, and presents evidence in a consistent and intuitive web interface. Importantly, the associations are extended beyond the organism in which they were originally described, by automatic transfer to orthologous protein pairs in other organisms, where applicable.

The winged helix transcription factor, FOXA2, is expressed in the foregut endoderm and in subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the fetal and adult lung. Because targeted mutagenesis of the Foxa2 gene in mice is lethal before formation of the lung, its potential role in lung morphogenesis and homeostasis has not been determined. We selectively deleted Foxa2 in respiratory epithelial cells in the developing mouse lung. Airspace enlargement, goblet cell hyperplasia, increased mucin and neutrophilic infiltration were observed in lungs of the Foxa2-deleted mice. Experimental goblet cell hyperplasia caused by ovalbumin sensitization,interleukin 4 (IL4), IL13 and targeted deletion of the gene encoding surfactant protein C (SP-C), was associated with either absent or decreased expression of Foxa2 in airway epithelial cells. Analysis of lung tissue from patients with a variety of pulmonary diseases revealed a strong inverse correlation between FOXA2 and goblet cell hyperplasia. FOXA2 is required for alveolarization and regulates airway epithelial cell differentiation in the postnatal lung.},

However, it remains unclear what drives the budding and branching of stratified epithelia, such as in the embryonic salivary gland and pancreas. Here, we performed live-organ imaging of mouse embryonic salivary glands at single-cell resolution to reveal that budding morphogenesis is driven by expansion and folding of a distinct epithelial surface cell sheet characterized by strong cell-matrix adhesions and weak cell-cell adhesions. Profiling of single-cell transcriptomes of this epithelium revealed spatial patterns of transcription underlying these cell adhesion differences. We then synthetically reconstituted budding morphogenesis by experimentally suppressing E-cadherin expression and inducing basement membrane formation in 3D spheroid cultures of engineered cells, which required b1-integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion for successful budding. Thus, stratified epithelial budding, the key first step of branching morphogenesis, is driven by an overall combination of strong cell-matrix adhesion and weak cell-cell adhesion by peripheral epithelial cells.},

  abstract = {Abstract | The reprogramming of somatic cells with defined factors, which converts cells from one lineage into cells of another, has greatly reshaped our traditional views on cell identity and cell fate determination. Direct reprogramming (also known as transdifferentiation) refers to cell fate conversion without transitioning through an intermediary pluripotent state. Given that the number of cell types that can be generated by direct reprogramming is rapidly increasing, it has become a promising strategy to produce functional cells for therapeutic purposes. This Review discusses the evolution of direct reprogramming from a transcription factor-based method to a small-molecule-driven approach, the recent progress in enhancing reprogrammed cell maturation, and the challenges associated with in~vivo direct reprogramming for translational applications. It also describes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying direct reprogramming, including the role of transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, non-coding RNAs, and the function of metabolic reprogramming, and highlights novel insights gained from single-cell omics studies.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Pulmonary alveolar type I (AT1) cells are essential for the gas-exchange function of lungs. AT1 cells retain their cellular plasticity during injury-induced alveolar regeneration. However, we know very little about the developmental heterogeneity of the AT1 cell population. Our study identified a robust genetic marker of postnatal AT1 cells, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (Igfbp2). We use this marker to demonstrate that the postnatal AT1 cell population actually consists of two AT1 cell subtypes (Hopx               +               Igfbp2               +               and Hopx               +               Igfbp2               −               AT1 cells) with distinct cell fates during alveolar regeneration. The large majority of adult AT1 cells expresses Igfbp2 and cannot transdifferentiate into AT2 cells during post pneumonectomy formation of new alveoli. Therefore, Hopx               +               Igfbp2               +               AT1 cells represent the terminally differentiated population of AT1 cells.                        ,                             Pulmonary alveolar type I (AT1) cells cover more than 95\% of alveolar surface and are essential for the air–blood barrier function of lungs. AT1 cells have been shown to retain developmental plasticity during alveolar regeneration. However, the development and heterogeneity of AT1 cells remain largely unknown. Here, we conducted a single-cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize postnatal AT1 cell development and identified insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (Igfbp2) as a genetic marker specifically expressed in postnatal AT1 cells. The portion of AT1 cells expressing Igfbp2 increases during alveologenesis and in post pneumonectomy (PNX) newly formed alveoli. We found that the adult AT1 cell population contains both Hopx               +               Igfbp2               +               and Hopx               +               Igfbp2               −               AT1 cells, which have distinct cell fates during alveolar regeneration. Using an               Igfbp2               -CreER mouse model, we demonstrate that Hopx               +               Igfbp2               +               AT1 cells represent terminally differentiated AT1 cells that are not able to transdifferentiate into AT2 cells during post-PNX alveolar regeneration. Our study provides tools and insights that will guide future investigations into the molecular and cellular mechanism or mechanisms underlying AT1 cell fate during lung development and regeneration.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the effects of ligation of the fibronectin receptor (FnR) on gene expression in rabbit synovial fibroblasts. Monoclonal antibodies to the FnR that block initial adhesion of fibroblasts to fibronectin induced the expression of genes encoding the secreted extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinases collagenase and stromelysin. That induction was a direct consequence of interaction with the FnR was shown by the accumulation of mRNA for stromelysin and collagenase. Monoclonal antibodies to several other membrane glycoprotein receptors had no effect on metalloproteinase gene expression. Less than 2 h of treatment of the fibroblasts with anti-FnR in solution was sufficient to trigger the change in gene expression, and induction was blocked by dexamethasone. Unlike other inducers of metalloproteinase expression, including phorbol diesters and growth factors, addition of the anti-FnR in solution to cells adherent to serum-derived adhesion proteins or collagen produced no detectable change in cell shape or actin microfilament organization. Inductive effects were potentiated by cross-linking of the ligand. Fab fragments of anti-FnR were ineffective unless cross-linked or immobilized on the substrate. Adhesion of fibroblasts to native fibronectin did not induce metallo-proteinases. However, adhesion to covalently immobilized peptides containing the arg-gly-asp sequence that were derived from fibronectin, varying in size from hexapeptides up to 120 kD, induced collagenase and stromelysin gene expression. This suggests that degradation products of fibronectin are the natural inductive ligands for the FnR. These data demonstrate that signals leading to changes in gene expression are transduced by the FnR, a member of the integrin family of extracellular matrix receptors. The signaling of changes in gene expression by the FnR is distinct from signaling involving cell shape and actin cytoarchitecture. At least two distinct signals are generated: the binding of fibronectin-derived fragments and adhesion-blocking antibodies to the FnR triggers events different from those triggered by binding of the native fibronectin ligand. Because the genes regulated by this integrin are for enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix, these results suggest that information transduced by the binding of various ligands to integrins may orchestrate the expression of genes regulating cell behavior in the extracellular environment.},

In previous work, we found that VEGF bound specifically to fibronectin (Fn) but not vitronectin or collagens. Herein we report that VEGF binds to the heparin-II domain of Fn and that the cell-binding and VEGF-binding domains of Fn, when physically linked, are necessary and sufficient to promote VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and Erk activation. Using recombinant Fn domains, the C-terminal heparin-II domain of Fn (type III repeats 13 to 14) was identified as a key VEGF-binding site. Mutation of the heparin-binding residues on FnIII               13–14               abolished VEGF binding, and peptides corresponding to the heparin-binding sequences in FnIII               13–14               inhibited VEGF binding to Fn. Fn fragments containing both the α               5               β               1               integrin-binding domain (III 9 to 10) and the VEGF-binding domain (III 13 to 14) significantly enhanced VEGF-induced EC migration and proliferation and induced strong phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor and Erk. Neither the cell-binding or VEGF-binding fragment of Fn alone had comparable VEGF-promoting effects. These results suggest that the mechanism of VEGF/Fn synergism is mediated extracellularly by the formation of a novel VEGF/Fn complex requiring both the cell-binding and VEGF-binding domains linked in a single molecular unit. These data also highlight a new function for the Fn C-terminal heparin-binding domain that may have important implications for angiogenesis and tumor growth.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disabling condition associated with progressive airflow limitation that is largely irreversible, with symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum production. In The Netherlands, COPD tends to be underpresented to physicians, underdiagnosed and undertreated by healthcare professionals, and poorly recognized among the general population. Improving the diagnosis and management of COPD in this country may require raised awareness of the impact of the disease on society. This may be achieved by providing detailed information on the burden of COPD on the patient, healthcare system and the economy. This information has now become available from Confronting COPD in North America and Europe, the first international survey to quantify the country-specific impact of the disease. An economic analysis of the results of the Dutch survey revealed the high cost of COPD to the healthcare system and society, with direct costs estimated at Euro 614 per patient Indirect costs amounted to Euro 410, bringing the annual per patient cost of COPD to Euro 1024. Around 50\% of the cost of COPD to the healthcare system was for prescription medication, including symptomatic medication and treatment for underlying airway inflammation. This contributed to effective symptom control in many patients, as shown by the low utilization of unscheduled healthcare (inpatient hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or contacts with healthcare professionals). However, the survey suggested that there was scope for improvement in the understanding of the origin and consequences of this disease among the general public, and the way COPD is managed by healthcare professionals, in order to increase the proportion of patients who are diagnosed with COPD and treated in accordance with management guidelines. In addition, smoking cessation intervention at the early stages of the disease could help to reduce the high costs associated with severe COPD in this country.},

  abstract = {Background DNA methylation profiles associated with childhood asthma might provide novel insights into disease pathogenesis. We did an epigenome-wide association study to assess methylation profiles associated with childhood asthma. Methods We did a large-scale epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) within the Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL) project. We examined epigenome-wide methylation using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChips (450K) in whole blood in 207 children with asthma and 610 controls at age 4–5 years, and 185 children with asthma and 546 controls at age 8 years using a cross-sectional case-control design. After identification of differentially methylated CpG sites in the discovery analysis, we did a validation study in children (4–16 years; 247 cases and 2949 controls) from six additional European cohorts and meta-analysed the results. We next investigated whether replicated CpG sites in cord blood predict later asthma in 1316 children. We subsequently investigated celltype-specific methylation of the identified CpG sites in eosinophils and respiratory epithelial cells and their related gene-expression signatures. We studied cell-type specificity of the asthma association of the replicated CpG sites in 455 respiratory epithelial cell samples, collected by nasal brushing of 16-year-old children as well as in DNA isolated from blood eosinophils (16 with asthma, eight controls [age 2–56 years]) and compared this with whole-blood DNA samples of 74 individuals with asthma and 93 controls (age 1–79 years). Whole-blood transcriptional profiles associated with replicated CpG sites were annotated using RNA-seq data of subsets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Findings 27 methylated CpG sites were identified in the discovery analysis. 14 of these CpG sites were replicated and passed genome-wide significance (p{$<$}1·14 × 10–⁷) after meta-analysis. Consistently lower methylation levels were observed at all associated loci across childhood from age 4 to 16 years in participants with asthma, but not in cord blood at birth. All 14 CpG sites were significantly associated with asthma in the second replication study using wholeblood DNA, and were strongly associated with asthma in purified eosinophils. Whole-blood transcriptional signatures associated with these CpG sites indicated increased activation of eosinophils, effector and memory CD8 T cells and natural killer cells, and reduced number of naive T cells. Five of the 14 CpG sites were associated with asthma in respiratory epithelial cells, indicating cross-tissue epigenetic effects. Interpretation Reduced whole-blood DNA methylation at 14 CpG sites acquired after birth was strongly associated with childhood asthma. These CpG sites and their associated transcriptional profiles indicate activation of eosinophils and cytotoxic T cells in childhood asthma. Our findings merit further investigations of the role of epigenetics in a clinical context.},

The mutant embryos start to show observable defects by day 9 of gestation and die around day 10–11. The alpha 5-null embryos have pronounced defects in posterior trunk and yolk sac mesodermal structures, suggesting a role for alpha 5 beta 1 integrin in mesoderm formation, movement or function. However, the embryos progress significantly further than embryos null for fibronectin, for which alpha 5 beta 1 integrin is a receptor, suggesting the involvement of other fibronectin receptors. In vitro studies on cells derived from the alpha 5-null embryos confirm that the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin is not expressed on mutant cells and show that the mutant cells are able to assemble fibronectin matrix, form focal contacts, and migrate on fibronectin despite the complete absence of the alpha 5 beta 1 fibronectin receptor integrin. All these functions have previously been thought to involve or require alpha 5 beta 1. The results presented show that these cellular functions involving fibronectin can proceed using other receptors.},

Through extension of deep learning-based prediction to interresidue orientations in addition to distances, and the development of a constrained optimization by Rosetta, we show that more accurate models can be generated. Results on a set of 18 de novo-designed proteins suggests the proposed method should be directly applicable to current challenges in de novo protein design.           ,              The prediction of interresidue contacts and distances from coevolutionary data using deep learning has considerably advanced protein structure prediction. Here, we build on these advances by developing a deep residual network for predicting interresidue orientations, in addition to distances, and a Rosetta-constrained energy-minimization protocol for rapidly and accurately generating structure models guided by these restraints. In benchmark tests on 13th Community-Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP13)- and Continuous Automated Model Evaluation (CAMEO)-derived sets, the method outperforms all previously described structure-prediction methods. Although trained entirely on native proteins, the network consistently assigns higher probability to de novo-designed proteins, identifying the key fold-determining residues and providing an independent quantitative measure of the “ideality” of a protein structure. The method promises to be useful for a broad range of protein structure prediction and design problems.},

Dysfunction in ASM plays a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to alterations of contractility, inflammatory response, immunoreaction, phenotype, quantity, and size of airways. ASM makes a key contribution in COPD by various mechanisms including altered contractility and relaxation induce by [Ca2+]i, cell proliferation and hypertrophy, production and modulation of extracellular cytokines, and release of pro-and-antiinflammatory mediators. Multiple dysfunctions of ASM contribute to modulating airway responses to stimuli, remodeling, and fibrosis, as well as influence the compliance of lungs. The present review highlights regulatory roles of multiple factors in the development of ASM dysfunction in COPD, aims to understand the regulatory mechanism by which ASM dysfunctions are initiated, and explores the clinical significance of ASM on alterations of airway structure and function in COPD and development of novel therapeutic strategies for COPD.},

  abstract = {SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine) is a unique matricellular glycoprotein that is expressed by many different types of cells and is associated with development, remodeling, cell turnover, and tissue repair. Its principal functions in vitro are counteradhesion and antiproliferation, which proceed via different signaling pathways. SPARC consists of three domains, each of which has independent activity and unique properties. The extracellular calcium binding module and the follistatin-like module have been recently crystallized. Specific interactions between SPARC and growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins, and cell surface proteins contribute to the diverse activities described for SPARC in vivo and in vitro. The location of SPARC in the nuclear matrix of certain proliferating cells, but only in the cytosol of postmitotic neurons, indicates potential functions of SPARC as a nuclear protein, which might be involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and mitosis. High levels of SPARC have been found in adult eye, and SPARC-null mice exhibit cataracts at 1–2 months of age. This animal model provides an excellent opportunity to confirm and explore some of the properties of SPARC, to investigate cataractogenesis, and to study SPARC-related family proteins, e.g., SC1/hevin, a counteradhesive matricellular protein that might functionally compensate for SPARC in certain tissues.},

A better understanding of the pathobiology of COPD is critical for the developing of novel therapies, as the majority of patients with the disease have little therapeutic options at the present time. The pathobiology of COPD encompasses multiple injurious processes including inflammation (excessive or inappropriate innate and adaptive immunity), cellular apoptosis, altered cellular and molecular alveolar maintenance program, abnormal cell repair, extracellular matrix destruction (protease and anti-protease imbalance), and oxidative stress (oxidant and antioxidant imbalance). These processes are triggered by urban and rural air pollutants and active and/or passive cigarette smoke and modified by cellular senescence and infection. A series of receptor-mediated signal transduction pathways are activated by reactive oxygen species and tobacco components, resulting in impairment of a variety of cell signaling and cytokine networks, subsequently leading to chronic airway responses with mucus production, airway remodeling, and alveolar destruction. The authors provide an updated insight into the molecular and cellular pathobiology of COPD based on human and/or animal data.},

  abstract = {Rationale: The decades-long progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) renders identifying different trajectories of disease progression challenging. Objectives: To identify subtypes of patients with COPD with distinct longitudinal progression patterns using a novel machinelearning tool called “Subtype and Stage Inference” (SuStaIn) and to evaluate the utility of SuStaIn for patient stratification in COPD. Methods: We applied SuStaIn to cross-sectional computed tomography imaging markers in 3,698 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 1–4 patients and 3,479 controls from the COPDGene (COPD Genetic Epidemiology) study to identify subtypes of patients with COPD. We confirmed the identified subtypes and progression patterns using ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints) data. We assessed the utility of SuStaIn for patient stratification by comparing SuStaIn subtypes and stages at baseline with longitudinal follow-up data. Measurements and Main Results: We identified two trajectories of disease progression in COPD: a “Tissue→Airway” subtype (n = 2,354, 70.4\%), in which small airway dysfunction and emphysema precede large airway wall abnormalities, and an “Airway→Tissue” subtype (n = 988, 29.6\%), in which large airway wall abnormalities precede emphysema and small airway dysfunction. Subtypes were reproducible in ECLIPSE. Baseline stage in both subtypes correlated with future FEV1/FVC decline (r = 20.16 [P , 0.001] in the Tissue→Airway group; r = 20.14 [P = 0.011] in the Airway→Tissue group). SuStaIn placed 30\% of smokers with normal lung function at elevated stages, suggesting imaging changes consistent with early COPD. Individuals with early changes were 2.5 times more likely to meet COPD diagnostic criteria at follow-up. Conclusions: We demonstrate two distinct patterns of disease progression in COPD using SuStaIn, likely representing different endotypes. One third of healthy smokers have detectable imaging changes, suggesting a new biomarker of “early COPD.”},

  abstract = {Summary             Panel count data, in which the observation for each study subject consists of the number of recurrent events between successive examinations, are commonly encountered in industrial reliability testing, medical research and other scientific investigations. We formulate the effects of potentially time-dependent covariates on one or more types of recurrent events through nonhomogeneous Poisson processes with random effects. We employ nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation under arbitrary examination schemes, and develop a simple and stable EM algorithm. We show that the resulting estimators of the regression parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal, with a covariance matrix that achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound and can be estimated using profile likelihood. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies and analysis of data from a skin cancer clinical trial.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The benefit of integrating batches of genomic data to increase statistical power is often hindered by batch effects, or unwanted variation in data caused by differences in technical factors across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used previously to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example that ComBat-seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

  abstract = {The lung's unique extracellular matrix (ECM), while providing structural support for cells, is critical in the regulation of developmental organogenesis, homeostasis and injury-repair responses. The ECM, via biochemical or biomechanical cues, regulates diverse cell functions, fate and phenotype. The composition and function of lung ECM become markedly deranged in pathological tissue remodeling. ECM-based therapeutics and bioengineering approaches represent promising novel strategies for regeneration/repair of the lung and treatment of chronic lung diseases. In this review, we assess the current state of lung ECM biology, including fundamental advances in ECM composition, dynamics, topography, and biomechanics; the role of the ECM in normal and aberrant lung development, adult lung diseases and autoimmunity; and ECM in the regulation of the stem cell niche. We identify opportunities to advance the field of lung ECM biology and provide a set recommendations for research priorities to advance knowledge that would inform novel approaches to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic lung diseases.},

  abstract = {Cigarette smoke (CS), a highly complex mixture containing more than 4,000 compounds, causes aberrant cell responses leading to tissue damage around the airways and alveoli, which underlies various lung diseases. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a family of enzymes that hydrolyze cyclic nucleotides. PDE inhibition induces bronchodilation, reduces the activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells, and the release of various cytokines. Currently, the selective PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast is an approved add-on treatment for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic bronchitis and a history of frequent exacerbations. Additional selective PDE inhibitors are being tested in preclinical and clinical studies. However, the effect of chronic CS exposure on the expression of PDEs is unknown. Using mRNA isolated from nasal and bronchial brushes and lung tissues of never smokers and current smokers, we compared the gene expression of 25 PDE coding genes. Additionally, the expression and distribution of PDE3A and PDE4D in human lung tissues was examined. This study reveals that chronic CS exposure modulates the expression of various PDE members. Thus, CS exposure may change the levels of intracellular cyclic nucleotides and thereby impact the efficiency of PDE-targeted therapies.},
