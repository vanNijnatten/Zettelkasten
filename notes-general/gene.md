# Interesting Genes
This is a list of interesting genes.

WNT - DKK1 -> Bone density?
CEACAM5? -> Spier distrofie? cell adhesie? also [[FN1]]
[[SERPINA1]] -> emphysema in lung
[[NR3C1]] -> glucocorticoid receptor
[[NR3C2]] -> Mineralocorticoid receptor
[[NR3C3]] -> Progesterone receptor
[[NR3C4]] -> Androgen receptor
[[AhR]] -> xenobiotic / smoking
nAChRs -> nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. alpha and beta subfamillies with multiple members! e.g. [[CHRNB1]], [[CHRNA1]], [[CHRNA7]]
LYNX1 -> Interacts with nAChRs
MAP2K1 -> Something with sex reversal 46XY-6
POSTN -> periostin, extracellular matrix protein, reflects airway epithelial injury, associated with Th2 driven inflammation and ICS response in asthma (doi.org/10.1183/13993003.congress-2018.pa1074 , doi.org/10.1186/s12931-018-0818-8)
ALOX15 - ALOX15 encodes arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase. It is a lipoxygenase that can oxidize PUFAs to corresponding hydroperoxy derivatives. ALOX15 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE). 15-HETE is further metabolized into various bioactive molecules. ALOX15 and its metabolites are important factors in the pathophysiology of asthma and COPD because of their role in the regulation of eosinophil-mediated inflammation, migration of immune, and airway remodeling (doi.org/10.4168/aair.2021.13.5.684)
[[COL6A1]] - collagen gene
MEX3D -- BCL2 (other gene)
BCL2 - apoptosis/autofagie
SPEDF - mucus related?
[[MUC5ac]] - regulators:foxa3, foxa2, spdef
[[MUC5b]] - damaging in alveoli? T-allele + protection
[[MUC12]]
CLCA1 - goblet cells
[[VEGFA]]
[[FN1]]
[[SPARC]]
PDGF
