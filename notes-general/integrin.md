# Integrins
>Cell-[[ECM]] interactions are mediated primarily by a family of cell surface receptors called [[integrins]] (Hynes, 1992) Integrins are **heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins** providing links between **extracellular matrix** and **intracellular cytoskeleton**, and may be involved in signal transduction processes. The ligands for integrins include a number of ECM proteins such as **fibronectin (FN), laminin, collagens and vitronectin**. Even though each integrin has a characteristic ligand specificity, many integrins have multiple ECM ligands and each ECM protein has multiple integrin receptors. (quoted from [^ref1])

Types
(More receptor/ligand connections can be found via Uniprot)
- Integrin α1 - CD49a - _[[ITGA1]]_
- Integrin α5 - CD49e - _[[ITGA5]]_/FNRA
- Integrin αv - CD51 - _[[ITGAV]]_
- Integrin β1 - CD29 - _[[ITGB1]]_
- Integrin β3 - CD61 - _[[ITGB3]]_

Combinations
 - α1β1 - receptor for [[laminin]] and [[collagen]]
 - α5β1 - receptor for [[FN1]] [^ref1], [[fibrinogen]] and [[PLA2G2A]]
 - αvβ3 - receptor for [[FN1]], 

## Research

## No reference
- α5β1 and αvβ3 interact with [[FN1]]
  - α5β1 interacts with the RGD region of FN (Pytela et al., 1985) [^ref1]
- Cells are able to migrate using [[FN1]] despite absence of (function of) α5β1 (quoted from [^ref1])
