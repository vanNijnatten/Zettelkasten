### Immune system in COPD 
irritants -> activate pattern recognition receptors (Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), and formyl-peptide receptors (FPRs) )
    innate immune response.
        inc neutrophils and macrophages,
            neutrophils excrete proteases that degrade elastin fibres. matrix metalloproteinases (MMP9 and MMP12)? -> emphysema 
            macrophages engulf and ‘eat’ particles, such as pollutants
        activation of airway epithelial cells and mucus secretion 
    Activation of adaptive immunity occurs later
        T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, dendritic cells.
        CD8+ T cells
            e.g. cytotoxic + regulatory T cell, CD8 helps interact w/ MHC-I on target cells
            increase in small airways when disease progresses
            reduced apoptosis (airway submucosa, M/M-COPD), more mature T cells, cause more tissue damage
            are mostly in the bronchial mucosa.
                no difference in numbers M/M COPD compared to normal or asymptomatic smokers 27 -> smoking effect),
        CD3+ cells
            All mature T cells, signal transduction
            submucosa
            inc in smoker normal compared to non-smokers normal 27,28 -> smoking effect,
        CD4+ T helper
            Co-receptor for the T-cell receptor, helps recognize antigens in MHC-II
            Increase in small airways when disease progresses
            CD4+ T helper 1 cells,
            CD4+ T helper 17 cells (neutrophil+ [?]).
        dendritic cells present antigens to other immune cells, such as T cells
        Some have inc eosinophils and sputum.
            release cytokines and chemokines
            eosinophils can contribute to sputum production?
            cause damage (eosinophil cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin)
Cytokines and Chemokines (No reason to specify these. Too much work.)
  Cytokines
    IL4 (excreted by basophils -> naïve+memory B-cell c8+neutrophils)
    IL5 (excreted by memory B-cell, all in VERY LOW numbers -> eosinophil + basophil)
    IL8 (excreted by Neutrophils, club cells, macrophages, Alveolar Type 2  Macrophages, T-cells (LOW))
    IL13 (excreted by ?? -> Macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils)
  Chemokines


lipid and peptide mediators, cytokines, chemokines.
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are pro  and lead to induction of proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon
Even cigarette smokers with normal lung function have increased airway inflammation, suggesting that this might be the normal immune response of the respiratory mucosa to inhaled irritants.
The amplified inflammatory response in COPD might be explained by the reduced expression of the nuclear enzyme histone deacetylase 2 (HD2, encoded by HDAC2) in cells such as macrophages and epithelial cells in the lungs of those with COPD, resulting in the activation of multiple inflammatory genes62.
inflammation in COPD persists after smoking cessation -> autonomous mechanism
lower respiratory tract -> Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae -> defect in the uptake (phagocytosis) of bacteria by macrophages
peripheral lung inflammation observed in COPD might also 'spill over' into the systemic circulation -> the systemic inflammation (not all COPD patients have this)

#### Smoking cessation
Ex-smokers have, compared to smokers,
less
- w/o copd: goblet cell hyperplasia
- Squamous metaplasia
  - w/o COPD: was not different in the central airways, but tended to be less abundant in the peripheral airways of ex-smokers
  - w/ COPD: more squamous metaplasia in central airways in ex-smokers; peripheral airways similar levels
- blood:
  - w/o copd: leukocyte counts
  - w/o copd: CD4 lymphocytes, and normalises after 2 yrs
- w/o copd: neutrophils
- marophages:
  - w/o copd: similar to non-smokers
  - w/ copd: lower in the airway lumen

higher
- w/o copd: natural killer cells
- w/ copd: inflammation in secretory glands in the central airways and in the wall of the peripheral airways

no difference in 
- w/o & w/ copd: smooth muscle mass
- w/o & w/ copd: fibrosis
- w/o copd: sputum
  - w/o copd: (IL)-8 levels


## In COPD
neutrophilia

## In Asthma
eosinophilia
