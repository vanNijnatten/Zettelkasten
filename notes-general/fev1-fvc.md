[[spirometry|Lung function]] tests. Can be measured pre- and post-bronchodilator. Normalised using [[gli|GLI-2012]] (UMCG) or [[nhanes|NHANES III]] normalization equations.

## Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)
...

## Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)
...

##  FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC
Also known as Tiffeneau-Index. This is the fraction of how much of your lung capacity you are able to exhale in 1 second; airflow limitation/obstruction.
Normal values are between 0.7 and 0.8. Used for COPD diagnosis (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC < 0.7)
