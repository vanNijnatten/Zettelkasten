# SPARC

## Summary
...

## Research
## Ideas
- 

### No reference
- Acts on [[PDGF]] (also angiogenesis??)
- Angiogenesis is not its main function

### Homo Sapiens:
- [[SPARC]] activates stromal fibroblasts only in the presence of _[[FN1]]  [^ref1] (Ishakawa [[cell-lines|cell line]])
- Matricellular glycoprotein, SPARC is a secreted molecule, that mediates the interaction between cells  and extracellular matrix. SPARC functions as a regulator of matrix organization and modulates cell behavior. Fibronectin mediates activation of stromal fibroblasts by SPARC in endometrial cancer cells.[^ref1]
- [[SPARC]] enhances _[[FN1]]_ expression in endometrial cancer stem-like cells [^ref2]
- **Quote**: SPARC appears to primarily act as an angiosuppressive molecule as it inhibits the expression and secretion of the key pro-angiogenic mediator [[VEGFA|VEGF]] and also acts to inhibit VEGF-induced growth of endothelial cells [^ref3][^ref4][^ref5]
- SPARC/osteonectin regulates secretion rates of [[FN1|fibronectin]] and [[laminin]]. [^ref6]
