# Normalisation

## CPM (EdgeR)
_CPM_ litterally means 'Counts Per Million'. A raw CPM calculated from a count matrix is
$$CPM=\cfrac{count}{lib size}*1\mathrm{e}{6}$$
In which _count_ is the count for a given gene in a sample, and _libsize_ is the total reads in a sample.

_LogCPM_ is the log (base 2) transformed version of _CPM_. The calculation however is totally different and takes into account a _prior_. This _prior_ is a number (per sample) added to the gene counts to make sure the log transformation can also happen even if the count for a gene is 0.

See also [[CPM.xlsx]].
