# Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)
...

## Statistics
**Hardy Weinberg equilibrium/principle**: allele/genotype frequencies remain stable over time if there is no evolutionary pressue. If someone studies SNPs, these SNPs should be in HW equilibirum in the control group.

## Tools
**HalpoReg**: "The SNPs underlay expression quantitative trait loci and were related to regulation of transcription factor binding and motif changes, which were predicted using [HaploReg](https://pubs.broadinstitute. org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php)."

# Interesting SNPs
 - rs909525(A;G) - Something with sex reversal 46XY-6
 - rs6323(T) - Something with sex reversal 46XY-6
 - rs3027399(G) - Something with sex reversal 46XY-6
